African countries promoted educational expansion with the expectation that it would lead to socio-economic development. The initial euphoria, however, was followed by skepticism and then disillusion.  Education, as it was being organized, delivered, received, and utilized, began to be perceived even as a hindrance to development. The course examines the relationship between formal education and individual and national development. Different paradigms of development, including modernization and dependency theories, and Third World Forum, are discussed with an emphasis on the perceived and actual roles of education in individual and national development. The issues to be discussed include education and schooling, the role of primary, secondary, and higher education in development, the problems of employment, language, equity in access and results with a focus on gender, race, and social class. Case studies, including selected countries of the different African sub-regions, will be used for illustration.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AG"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":360004,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"EDUC","catalogNbr":"5440","titleShort":"Curriculum and Instruction","titleLong":"Curriculum and Instruction","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17564,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"bpd38","firstName":"Bryan","middleName":"P.","lastName":"Duff"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Kennedy Hall 103","bldgDescr":"Kennedy Hall","facilityDescrshort":"KND103","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Prereqs: EDUC 2410 (Art of Teaching) or permission of instructor."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Focuses on deep exploration of two questions: What should students be learning in schools?
