Veterinarians assist researchers in achieving their goals, while encouraging replacement, reduction and refinement of animal use. Treatment of animals and preparation of preventive medicine programs requires the laboratory animal veterinarian to have knowledge of the biology and comparative medicine of a wide variety of species. Current knowledge of research methodologies and animal models of disease as well as a good understanding of state and federal regulations and guidelines governing the use of animals is essential for a laboratory animal veterinarian. In addition, occupational health and safety and animal facility design are important parts of an institutional animal care program and laboratory animal veterinarians have input in these areas. The diversity of species and the novel circumstances that arise regularly in this field make laboratory animal medicine an exciting and unique discipline of veterinary medicine.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: VTMED 5510.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: third- and fourth-year veterinary students.

The student is expected to assist in all aspects of the rotation, including patient receiving, medical and surgical treatments, client communication, and record-keeping. In addition to clinical exposure, the student will be taught principles of clinical neurology during \"sit-down\" topic rounds. The primary goal of the rotation for the student is for the student to become comfortable in performing and correctly interpreting the neurologic examination in a clinical setting. A secondary goal is the accumulation and application of practical clinical knowledge pertaining to neurologic disease of companion animals.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: VTMED 5510.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: third- and fourth- year veterinary students.
