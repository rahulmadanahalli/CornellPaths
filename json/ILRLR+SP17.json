Close attention will be given to several historical factors that have helped shape Mexican American working-class identity. Ultimately, the course will determine how ethnic Mexican workers have contested their purported role as 'cheap' and 'tractable' labor to demand better wages, working conditions, and an end to the socio-economic discrimination they encountered.

This course begins in the late nineteenth century, defining it as a pivotal moment in U.S. immigration and labor history when efforts to regulate immigrant entry and naturalization became increasingly bureaucratized. As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective. We will also address questions regarding the perceived benefit and cost of immigration at both the national and local (i.e., community) levels. In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time. Finally, we will consider how immigrants have negotiated the pressures of their new surroundings, and challenged dominant conceptions of American national identity and citizenship in the process.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":367939,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"3300","titleShort":"Argumentation

rhetorical inquiry into whether and when the technological change engendered by digitization and the so-called \"Information Technology (IT) Revolution\" benefits workers.  We then consider the broader impact of recent technological advances on manufacturing and fabrication, low- and semi-skilled service work, i.e., restaurant servers and bus drivers, and even on expert and professional work like that to which most of you presumably aspire.  Among the central themes is the notion that technology does not unilaterally act upon workers, their employers, or society-at-large.  Rather, workers, managers, customers, institutions, and policymakers shape which advances take hold and which do not, the ways that these technologies are deployed in the workplace, and the ways that society can actively mitigate the costs to technological advancement while harnessing its benefits.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":350326,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"4880","titleShort":"Justice","titleLong":"Justice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17048,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"meg3","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"Evan","lastName":"Gold"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Ives

Each student will work on a project related to her/his research, and you must begin the semester with an outline or draft of a qualifying paper, dissertation chapter, manuscript or funding proposal that you want to develop. Each week will discuss a group of readings focused on the craft of social science writing and go over assigned writing exercises. Key issues we will discuss include: refining research questions, constructing relevant literature reviews, how to leverage empirical evidence to advance your argument effectively, journal selection, responding to reviewers concerns, seeking external funding, and practical tips for writing productivity. You will also be responsible for doing a close reading of a peer’s draft, and facilitating a workshop discussion. Everyone will get a chance to put their writing under the microscope at least once. While the course is geared towards PhD students engaged in academic research and publication, Masters-levels students are also invited to join."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Graduate Writing Seminar"}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"002","classNbr":15279,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"03/17/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lha1","firstName":"Lee","middleName":"Howard","lastName":"Adler"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 112","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS112","meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"While the Brown decision seemed to end de jure segregation in America, a series of court cases and continuing housing, lending and other nationwide policies interfered with our Nation’s ability to end de facto segregation.

It will be open to both ILR and non-ILR students at the upper division and graduate level who have a sufficient background in the social sciences.  Enrollment open to ILR and non-ILR juniors, seniors, and graduate students.  Limited to 30 students.  The proposed course will introduce students to the theory of collaborative or interest-based conflict resolution and will describe recent efforts to use these techniques to resolve important public policy issues.   The course will be based substantially, but not exclusively, on the work of the Convergence Center for Policy Resolution, a national non-profit organization based in Washington, DC, which has been applying collaborative problem solving to issues of importance at the national policy level for several years.  Three cases of collaborative decision making will be examined in detail:  health care coverage and the Affordable Care Act; nutrition and wellness; and education reform.  Robert Fersh, ILR B.S. ¿72, J.D.
