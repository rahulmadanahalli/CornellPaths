We try to better understand the ways in which popular culture shapes and/or reflects American values. The course also depicts popular culture as \"contested terrain,\" the place where social classes, racial and ethnic groups, women and men, the powerful and less powerful seek to \"control\" images and themes. Topics include The Honeymooners and 1950s television, soap operas; \"gross-out\" movies; Elvis; the Beatles, and Guns 'n Roses; gothic romances; and People Magazine and USA Today.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2580,"crseId":351417,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3141","titleShort":"Prisons","titleLong":"Prisons","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1004,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"12/26/2014","endDt":"01/17/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dt324","firstName":"Danielle","middleName":"","lastName":"Thomsen"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information go to: http://www.sce.cornell.edu/ws/courses/courses.php?v=2410"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"12/26/2014","endDt":"01/17/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"DW","instrModeDescrshort":"DL WWW","instrModeDescr":"Distance Learning - WWW","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"3141","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"DYN","sessionBeginDt":"12/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"01/17/2015","sessionLong":"Dynamic Session"}],"description":"The United States stands alone among Western, industrialized countries with its persistent, high rates of incarceration, long sentences, and continued use of the death penalty. This \"American exceptionalism\" -- the turn to mass incarceration -- has been fostered by the use of sharply-delineated categories that define vast numbers of people as outlaws and others as law-abiding. Our purpose in this course is to understand how social and political actors have utitlized ideas that have deep roots in American political thought (ideas about rights, race, and responsibility) in ways that have now come to define large groups of the population as 'carcerable.'","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, winter, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"(GP)","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2580,"crseId":363031,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4696","titleShort":"The Art Market","titleLong":"The Art Market","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"100","classNbr":1006,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/02/2015","endDt":"01/17/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"cf86","firstName":"Cheryl","middleName":"","lastName":"Finley"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information go to: http://www.sce.cornell.edu/ws/courses/courses.php?v=2737"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/02/2015","endDt":"01/17/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"DW","instrModeDescrshort":"DL WWW","instrModeDescr":"Distance Learning - WWW","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"4696","type":"C"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4696","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"WS","sessionBeginDt":"01/02/2015","sessionEndDt":"01/17/2015","sessionLong":"Winter Session"}],"description":"This course will examine the history of the art market, from the 16th century to the present.
