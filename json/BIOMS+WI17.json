This branch of science began more than 100 years ago with the discovery of the eggs of the human blood fluke, a schistosome, in histologic sections of tissues from organs of Egyptian mummies. The work expanded in modern times as it became associated both with archaeology and paleoanthropology. Much of the research today utilizes minimally invasive methods to examine ancient remains and is aided greatly by new molecular approaches. The course will examine the different methodologies and findings that have been unearthed in Ancient Egypt and north Africa in natural and manmade mummified remains of humans and animals and through the careful examination of different archaeological sites.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Winter, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Ability to identify major periods of larger north African civilization since about 4000 BCE.","Categorization of characters important in the preservation of paleoparasitologic samples.","Capability of listing and briefly describing how various techniques involving radiology, ultrasound, microscopy, immunologic, and molecular methods can answer very direct questions about samples thousands of years old.","Capability of describing several parasitic diseases of ancient peoples and how these diseases were acquired.","Develop an appreciation as to how easily great deal can be learned about ancient civilizations through the tools of utilized by paleoparasitologists and related disciplines."],"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG"}]
