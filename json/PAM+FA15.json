Numerous examples are taken from a variety of policy areas, including crime, education, health, welfare, and regulation.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: PAM 2000, PAM 2300.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Explain how to conduct cost-benefit analysis of government projects.","Calculate the discounted present value of future costs and benefits.","Evaluate distributional effects of public policies.","Apply uncertainty and risk to policy analysis.","Explain how to evaluate non-market activities such as environmental policy and the value of a statistical life."],"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"HE"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":366454,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PAM","catalogNbr":"5340","titleShort":"Infrastructure Policy","titleLong":"Regulation and Infrastructure Policy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15289,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"rrg24","firstName":"Rick","middleName":"","lastName":"Geddes"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall 280","bldgDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MVR280","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"PAM","catalogNbr":"4640","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Infrastructure provides essential services such as road and highway transportation, ports and airports, communications, electricity, clean drinking water, and wastewater treatment.

The four valuation methods covered are net present value of free cash flows, decision tree analysis/real options, multiples, and the venture capital method. Seven cases allow students to apply these skills to examine decisions/situations such as determining why a Medicare HMO is losing money and recommending a redesigned benefit and reimbursement structure, estimating a health system's profitability by product line; valuing a drug that is being developed, valuing a pharmaceutical company, and valuing a drug using decision-free analysis in determining whether a medical device company should go public and how it should price its products.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: PAM 5620 or other financial management course.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Develop and justify operating and strategic decisions for various health care organizations."],"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"HE"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":365404,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PAM","catalogNbr":"5641","titleShort":"Health IT","titleLong":"Health Information Technology and Quality","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15157,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"05:00PM","startDt":"11/13/2015","endDt":"11/13/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sn243","firstName":"Sean","middleName":"","lastName":"Nicholson"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"05:00PM","startDt":"11/14/2015","endDt":"11/14/2015","instructors":[],"pattern":"S","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":3,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"12:00PM","startDt":"11/15/2015","endDt":"11/15/2015","instructors":[],"pattern":"Su","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Enrollment limited to Sloan students only."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"11/13/2015","endDt":"11/15/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course introduces efforts to improve healthcare quality through health information technology (IT) in the United States.
