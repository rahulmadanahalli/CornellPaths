We will analyze major themes such as race and class relations, gender and the family, immigration and globalization, religion and community activism. In the first half of this course, we will learn fundamental concepts and ideas by examining major events, including the Asian American Movement, the murder of Vincent Chin, and the LA Uprisings. In the second half of this course, we will examine how race and gender relations change alongside contemporary moments of globalization and the economy through a variety of topics including interracial marriages, refugees and welfare, the Tiger Mother, and affirmative action.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS if taken for 4 credits)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":357919,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AAS","catalogNbr":"2620","titleShort":"Intro to Asian Am Lit","titleLong":"Introduction to Asian American Literature","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17219,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ssw6","firstName":"Sunn","middleName":"Shelley","lastName":"Wong"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2620","type":"C"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"2620","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course will introduce both a variety of writings by Asian North American authors and some critical issues concerning the production and reception of Asian American texts.

While there will be occasion to discuss what \"Chineseness\" means in different Asian contexts, this course will focus primarily on how ideas of \"China\" and \"Chineseness\" have been historically constructed by, for, and in the West—particularly in the US.

But, who are the \"Asians?\" On what basis can we label \"Asians\" an ethnic group? Although there is a significant Asian presence in the Caribbean, the category \"Asian\" itself does not exist in the Caribbean. What does this say about the nature of categories that label and demarcate groups of people on the basis of alleged cultural and phenotypical characteristics? This course will examine the dynamics behind group identity, namely ethnicity, by comparing and contrasting the multicultural experience of Asian populations in the Caribbean and the United States. Ethnographic case studies will focus on the East Indian and Chinese experiences in the Caribbean and the Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Filipino, and Indian experiences in the United States.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":351007,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"AAS","catalogNbr":"4950","titleShort":"Independent Study","titleLong":"Independent Study","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":7038,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"dsc37","firstName":"Derek","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Chang"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"602","classNbr":9611,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"vpm1","firstName":"Viranjini","middleName":"P.","lastName":"Munasinghe"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Independent reading course in topics not covered in regularly scheduled courses.
