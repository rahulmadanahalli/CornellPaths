Two main questions guide the course: what are the key patterns of argument related to time in the Western tradition? How did scientific knowledge, cross-cultural encounters and methodological disputes shape or change these patterns? The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were a period of rapid temporal expansion in both extent and detail: geology shifted the scale of time, and chronological work propelled claims for a truly \"universal\" history.  Departing from these developments, the course explores how temporal ideas have functioned within and shaped different disciplinary and institutional contexts.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":367792,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SHUM","catalogNbr":"4507","titleShort":"Counter-Time: Contemporary Art","titleLong":"Counter-Time: Anachronism and Obsolescence in Contemporary Art","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17487,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mah422","firstName":"Miguel","middleName":"Angel","lastName":"Hernandez Navarro"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"A D White House 110","bldgDescr":"A D White House","facilityDescrshort":"ADW110","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"4577","type":"C"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4006","type":"C"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4577","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The aim of this course is to present a map of theories and artistic strategies in order to better understand the validity of the anachronism and obsolescence in today's culture. During recent years, artists have started to work incorporating technologies, iconographies, references and elements that do not belong to the present timeline. Obsolescence in particular is used as a master strategy to display the alteration of temporality. A whole host of theorists and art historians also have used anachronism as a methodological tool and have advocated for an anachronistic interpretation of contemporary art. Theorists to include: Bloch, Benjamin, Didi-Huberman, Bal, Nagel, Terry Smith, Moxey, Rancière and Negri.

We will examine musical innovators' theater of resistance towards complete synchronization and how they have indicated different ways for a group to move through time together, from Schoenberg and Stravinsky to Miles Davis, John Cage, Japanese noise compositions, and post-minimalist repetition. Each week will pair close readings of theoretical texts with close listenings of relevant music. Readings include: Nietzsche, Adorno, Bataille, Foucault, Agamben, Gilroy, Hegarty, Andriessen, Feldman, Olaniyan, Born, Beckles Willson. In the final weeks we will turn to the complex politics of contemporary musical ventures that reject both the trappings of national or tribal identifications and international avant-garde
