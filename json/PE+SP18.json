The class will focus on gaining some mastery of each of the dances taught, developing partnering skills, technique, movement, styling and musicality.

Salsa, arguably the most popular social dance in the world, derives from the Cuban rhythm of Son, while it grew to world fame through its growth in New York City and Puerto Rico. The development of Salsa as a dance form follows its development as a musical genre. Bachata and Merengue, meanwhile, are considered quintessential dances of the Dominican Republic. Comparsa is Cuban Carnival line dance. In this course, we learn the basics of all of these dances. Instruction emphasizes the development of dance foundations in musical timing, rhythm, body movement, lead-follow connection, and space use. Class begins with a stretching and body movement warm-up. We then teach dance steps and movement patterns across the floor, in rotating lines, as freestyle, and in partner format. The skills learned in each dance are interrelated - as you improve in one you will improve in the others. Dancing with live percussion at one or more of our classes will help connect the dots of timing, rhythm and motion. By the end of this course you will be able to take Latin dance to a higher level and pick up other partnered dances. No partner is necessary to register. Couple sign-up is encouraged. Partners rotate. This class is gender-free. Each student is free to learn the lead or follow role.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"Course Fee: TBA.","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AT"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":360588,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PE","catalogNbr":"1162","titleShort":"Salsa","titleLong":"Salsa","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":9944,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:00PM","timeEnd":"09:30PM","startDt":"01/28/2018","endDt":"05/06/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mlr24","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"Luis","lastName":"Ristorucci"}],"pattern":"Su","facilityDescr":"Helen Newman Hall 230","bldgDescr":"Helen Newman Hall","facilityDescrshort":"HNH230","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Course fee $90.Deadlines: Last day to add: Wed.

Class begins with a warm-up of Salsa step patterns, where we review and introduce variations called \"shines.\" We then move into partner work, learning turn patterns with rotating partners. Latin body movement and rhythm is taught in the warm-up and partner work sections. In partner work, special emphasis is placed on: lead-follow connection; frame and tension; spatial awareness; nuance, flow and savvy. Salsa in Rueda de Casino format will be introduced later in the semester as an additional way to enjoy Salsa. In Rueda, dancers change partners within a circle and perform dynamic combinations to the arrangement of a caller. Learning aids include a syllabus, music and video tutorial. Requirements: Ability to hear and dance to Salsa music on the timing of \"quick quick slow\". It is also useful, though not required, to have some knowledge of basic Salsa step variations, the right turn, open-break turn, and cross-body lead. No partner necessary, though encouraged. This class is gender-free in that every student is free to choose the lead or follow as their dominant role.

Whether it is during fall foliage or spring wildflowers and bird migrations, the natural beauty of the 'Gunks is superb and the climbing is some of the best in the world. A student-to-instructor ratio of 2:1 ensures individual attention and plenty of climbing for all.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"Includes fallbreak or senior-week trip.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: Basic Rock Climbing or equivalent experience, Top rope belay certification minimum, Lead belay recommended.","catalogFee":"Course fee charged.","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AT"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":362658,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PE","catalogNbr":"1654","titleShort":"Ice Climbing","titleLong":"Ice Climbing","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":9933,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"06:00PM","timeEnd":"09:00PM","startDt":"01/25/2018","endDt":"01/25/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"anm67","firstName":"Andrew","middleName":"N.","lastName":"McLaughlin"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Bartels Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Bartels Hall","facilityDescrshort":"BTLB01","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"05:00PM","startDt":"01/27/2018","endDt":"02/10/2018","instructors":[],"pattern":"S","facilityDescr":"Bartels Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Bartels Hall","facilityDescrshort":"BTLB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Ice Climbing in the Finger Lakes: Drop Deadline: Wed, Jan 24th; Course Fee: $295; For more Information: https://coe.cornell.edu/ice-climbing-fingerlakes-spring"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2018","endDt":"02/10/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"002","classNbr":9981,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"05:00PM","timeEnd":"08:00PM","startDt":"02/12/2018","endDt":"02/14/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"anm67","firstName":"Andrew","middleName":"N.","lastName":"McLaughlin"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Bartels Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Bartels Hall","facilityDescrshort":"BTLB01","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"05:00PM","timeEnd":"11:59PM","startDt":"02/16/2018","endDt":"02/16/2018","instructors":[],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Bartels Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Bartels Hall","facilityDescrshort":"BTLB01","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":3,"timeStart":"12:01AM","timeEnd":"11:59PM","startDt":"02/17/2018","endDt":"02/19/2018","instructors":[],"pattern":"MSSu","facilityDescr":"Bartels Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Bartels Hall","facilityDescrshort":"BTLB01","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":4,"timeStart":"12:01AM","timeEnd":"05:00PM","startDt":"02/20/2018","endDt":"02/20/2018","instructors":[],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Bartels Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Bartels Hall","facilityDescrshort":"BTLB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Ice climbing in the Adirondacks: Drop Deadline: Wed, Jan 24th; Course Fee: $425; For more Information: https://coe.cornell.edu/ice-climbing-adirondacks-spring"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"02/12/2018","endDt":"02/20/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Basic top-rope ice climbing instruction.
