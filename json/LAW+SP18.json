The reading will be largely comprised of reported death penalty cases, but will be augmented by a variety of other sources, including empirical studies of the death penalty and the litigation experience of the professors. Although the focus will be on capital punishment as practiced in the United States, we will also consider international and comparative perspectives. Guest speakers will provide a range of views, and law students with experience working on capital cases will lead discussion sections.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: undergraduates only.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":362619,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"4131","titleShort":"Nature Functions Limits of Law","titleLong":"The Nature, Functions, and Limits of Law","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17452,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dmc66","firstName":"Dawn","middleName":"Michelle","lastName":"Chutkow"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 184","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH184","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3131","type":"C"},{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"3131","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"A general-education course to acquaint students with how our legal system pursues the goals of society.

course designed to introduce first-year students to lawyering skills, with primary emphasis on legal writing, analysis, research, and oral presentations. Assignments are usually set in the context of a simulated law office (or judge's chambers). In the fall semester, students write predictive memoranda that point out the strengths and weaknesses of their client's case. To prepare the memoranda, students may need to determine the facts of the case by conducting interviews or depositions. Acting as junior attorneys, students will also make an oral presentation to a supervising attorney. The spring semester focuses on persuasive advocacy. Students prepare a memorandum, motion, or brief for submission to a court and, later, orally argue for their positions in a simulated court session. Throughout the year, students also learn the fundamentals of legal research. Instruction occurs not only in full-class sessions but also in individual conferences.

Arizona decision as it has evolved over time.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":351918,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6301","titleShort":"Directed Reading","titleLong":"Directed Reading","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"201","classNbr":17748,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["DIS"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"202","classNbr":17749,"meetings":[],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["DIS"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"An examination of a topic through readings selected by arrangement between the instructor and an individual student or group of students (not exceeding eight).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"Arrange directly with instructor.

Another significant theme is the prevention of attorney discipline and malpractice liability through advance planning.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Enrolling in this course does not prohibit enrollment in another professional responsibility course.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the professional responsibility requirement.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":369384,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6647","titleShort":"Law and Policy of Food Systems","titleLong":"Law and Policy of Food Systems","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17870,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"06:05PM","timeEnd":"07:30PM","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sg899","firstName":"Sergio Alberto","middleName":"","lastName":"Gramitto Ricci"},{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"gt276","firstName":"Gerald","middleName":"","lastName":"Torres"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 276","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH276","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":null,"catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":351565,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6661","titleShort":"Const'l Law of the Eur.

What should a lawyer do when her professional duties conflict with her financial interests or obligations to friends or family? How does the legal profession's monopoly on the right to give legal advice shape the justice system? We will investigate such questions by reading relevant legal materials as well as work by legal academics.

Over the past several decades, increasing numbers of social scientists have conducted systematic research on the operation of law and legal institutions. At the same time, social scientists themselves are testifying as experts in increasing numbers, encouraging lawyers and judges at both the trial and appellate levels to rely on social science evidence to decide cases. Social science research is also used as a tool in law reform. The aim of the course is to develop a critical analysis of these uses of social science in law and litigation. Are social scientists asking the right questions? Are lawyers, judges, legislators, and legal reformers using social science findings appropriately? Is the law's increasing reliance on social science problematic or advantageous -- or both?","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":363339,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6844","titleShort":"State and Local Government","titleLong":"State and Local Government","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17787,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:10PM","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lu27","firstName":"Laura","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Underkuffler"}],"pattern":"TWR","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 186","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH186","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"State and local governments have long been regarded as \"laboratories\" for possible solutions to difficult social issues, and as political institutions that are closest to the people. In additional to traditional concerns, state and local governments in recent years have been the primary actors in contentious areas such as health care reform, gay marriage legalization, campaign finance reform, property rights protection, and other issues. This course will examine the powers of and legal restraints on state and local governments in state systems, and as a part of the American constitutional order. Topics will include state constitutions, the rights that they confer, and their methods of interpretation; local government boundary formation and boundary change; state and local service, police, and taxing powers; the emergence of supra-local (regional) government; and the place of state and local governments in the federal system (including commerce clause, privileges and immunities clause, and taxation issues). The final part of the course will consider several areas of recent and future litigation - such as the interstate validity of gay marriages and federal challenges to states' medical and health reforms - as a way to illustrate the difficult issues of conflicting sovereignty that this area of law presents.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":351949,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6871","titleShort":"Supervised Writing","titleLong":"Supervised Writing","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":17797,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"602","classNbr":17798,"meetings":[],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"603","classNbr":17799,"meetings":[],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"Arrange directly with instructor.

Interdisciplinary approaches will be employed in this seminar to facilitate understanding of Chinese legal tradition and its modern transformations, which include the efforts since the late 19th century of borrowing Western law and institutions and implementing current law reforms in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Readings are drawn from English translations of Chinese codes, cases and literary works, and academic writings by Western and Chinese scholars.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the writing requirement.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":365562,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7146","titleShort":"Comparative Legal Philosophy","titleLong":"Comparative Legal Philosophy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17880,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"xy64","firstName":"Xingzhong","middleName":"","lastName":"Yu"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 279","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH279","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar introduces students to the philosophy of law from a comparative perspective, focusing on such topics as the concept of law, the nature of judicial reasoning, theories of justice and righteousness,morality and religion, rights and obligations, and theories of rewarding and punishment.

We then proceed to apply these analytical structures to various substantive areas of law of particular concern to women, including but not limited to rape and other types of violence against women; pornography; prostitution; abortion, surrogacy and other reproductive rights issues.

Grading will be based on a research paper, response papers, and class presentations and participation.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":364209,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7398","titleShort":"Land Use","titleLong":"Land Use","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17899,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:00PM","timeEnd":"04:00PM","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"emp3","firstName":"Eduardo","middleName":"Moises","lastName":"Peñalver"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 389","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH389","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":null,"catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":362563,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7412","titleShort":"Law and Humanities Colloquium","titleLong":"Law and Humanities Colloquium","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17481,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"esa52","firstName":"Elizabeth","middleName":"","lastName":"Anker"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 276","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH276","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"7412","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"In an era of increasing interdisciplinary collaboration, the fields that comprise the humanities are engaging in new ways with law as well as with each other, and projects developed within the context of law schools themselves bear renewed relevance to the humanities. This colloquium will bring together scholars working at the forefront of legal history, law and literature, law and culture, and critical theory from the institutional vantage points of both law and the humanities. This year, the colloquium will focus on the topic of \"law and justice.\" The course will begin with three weeks of seminar designed to apprise students of existing work in law and the humanities and to situate current developments within this broader frame, concentrating on the often complicated relationship between law and justice. We will examine, for example, debates about voting, trial procedure, the prison system, citizenship, and other aspects of democratic process. After the introductory sessions, the remainder of the course will be organized around a series of speakers, some drawn from Cornell and some from other universities. Students will be required to write six three- to five-page papers responding to the speakers' pre-circulated talks.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the writing requirement.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":363512,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7580","titleShort":"Markets, Morals and Methods","titleLong":"Markets, Morals, and Methods","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17903,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rch37","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"C.","lastName":"Hockett"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 279","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH279","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar is devoted to the foundations of choice, agency, and welfare -- matters that lie at the core of normative legal and economic theory. Readings, guest speakers, and class discussion will focus on the nature of preferences, reasons, and norms, as well as (a) their inter-relations and (b) their roles in guiding human decision and action. A central theme will be the question whether and to what degree welfare, well-being, and wealth for that matter can be understood apart from and even as determinative of normative propriety (\"rightness\" and \"wrongness\"), or whether instead these concepts presuppose a prior conception of normative propriety. Many legal and economic theorists seem to assume the former, but this assumption can -- and in this course will -- be examined critically.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the writing requirement.","catalogPermission":"Limited enrollment.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":351537,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"9901","titleShort":"Graduate Research","titleLong":"Graduate Research","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"RSC","ssrComponentLong":"Research","section":"701","classNbr":17843,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":12,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["RSC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: J.S.D.
