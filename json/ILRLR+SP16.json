We begin by reviewing the legal foundations of immigrant labor, including the current immigration enforcement regime, and the role of legal status in labor standards enforcement protections. We examine how organized labor has evolved with regards to immigrant workers, shifting from supporting employer sanctions in 1986, to repudiating them as a tool for employer control in 2001. We then evaluate the role that immigrant workers have played in the revitalization of the labor movement, and the challenges that remain for unions. Beyond unions, we examine the emergence of new forms of worker representation, including the varying types of worker centers. We focus on the proliferation of day labor centers, and more recently, non-union efforts to organize workers in the restaurant industry. We even consider the role of undocumented workers in the public sector, made possible through the increased use of subcontracting. We look at how public entities have turned to worker organizations to help hold employers accountable, and how workers have turned to local governments to strengthen worker protections (such as higher minimum wages and strengthened penalties for wage theft), as well as how states have become new targets for policy change (such as recent victories for domestic workers). We will also discuss binational efforts to advance immigrant worker rights. We end by considering prospects for federal immigration reform, and the implications these proposals may have for immigrant worker rights."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Immigrant Worker Organizing"}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Topics change depending on semester and instructor.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the ILR Advanced Writing requirement.","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 ILR Sophomores or permission of the instructor. ","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":365970,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"3022","titleShort":"Capitalism&American Democracy","titleLong":"Capitalism and American Democracy: 1880-2010","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17566,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"nas4","firstName":"Nick","middleName":"","lastName":"Salvatore"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 217","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS217","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3022","type":"C"},{"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"3022","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course explores the changing relationship between democratic practice and the evolving corporate form of capitalism during the late 19th and 20th centuries.

This course begins in the late nineteenth century, defining it as a pivotal moment in U.S. immigration and labor history when efforts to regulate immigrant entry and naturalization became increasingly bureaucratized. As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective. We will also address questions regarding the perceived benefit and cost of immigration at both the national and local (i.e., community) levels. In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time. Finally, we will consider how immigrants have negotiated the pressures of their new surroundings, and challenged dominant conceptions of American national identity and citizenship in the process.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":367939,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"3300","titleShort":"Argumentation

Detailed coverage of the standards of contract interpretation, discipline and the role of evidence will be provided. Throughout the course, role-plays and other assignments will test students' understanding of the critical role of the arbitrator in deciding labor disputes.
