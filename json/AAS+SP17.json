In the first half of this course, we will learn fundamental concepts and ideas by examining major events, including the Asian American Movement, the murder of Vincent Chin, and the LA Uprisings. In the second half of this course, we will examine how race and gender relations change alongside contemporary moments of globalization and the economy through a variety of topics including interracial marriages, refugees and welfare, the Tiger Mother, and affirmative action.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS if taken for 4 credits).","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":366671,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AAS","catalogNbr":"2800","titleShort":"Cultural Psychology","titleLong":"Cultural Psychology","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":8820,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"qw23","firstName":"Qi","middleName":"","lastName":"Wang"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall 280","bldgDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MVR280","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"HD","catalogNbr":"2800","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course focuses on the cutting-edge research from the recently emerged, exciting field of cultural psychology.

But, who are the \"Asians?\" On what basis can we label \"Asians\" an ethnic group? Although there is a significant Asian presence in the Caribbean, the category \"Asian\" itself does not exist in the Caribbean. What does this say about the nature of categories that label and demarcate groups of people on the basis of alleged cultural and phenotypical characteristics? This course will examine the dynamics behind group identity, namely ethnicity, by comparing and contrasting the multicultural experience of Asian populations in the Caribbean and the United States.
