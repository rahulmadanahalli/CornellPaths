introduce students to the field of human resource management (HRM). Students learn theories and applications involved in effectively managing people in organizations. In addition, this course covers current topics in HRM that have resulted from environmental and organizational challenges (e.g., technology, globalization, legislation, restructuring, work/life balance, changing labor markets). Emphasis is placed on developing relevant problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, as the basic concepts of HRM and the skills developed in this course are applicable to all types of organizations and jobs in which students will eventually work.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, winter, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":367411,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRHR","catalogNbr":"2640","titleShort":"Diversity & Inclusion","titleLong":"Diversity and Inclusion","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16683,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dp597","firstName":"Devon","middleName":"","lastName":"Proudfoot"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2018","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Although Title VII of the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964 to prohibit employment discrimination based on an individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and other employment legislation has since been passed to prohibit discrimination based on other group characteristics such as age, sexual orientation, and disability status, claims of discrimination have been on the rise. This suggests that much work remains to be done in organizations. The purpose of this course is to introduce current theory, research, and practice regarding discrimination and inclusion in the workplace.  We will adopt a largely psychological approach to understanding bias, stereotyping, and prejudice and how they manifest in organizations. We will also examine the role of HR and diversity practices as well as leadership behaviors in fostering inclusion. A guiding assumption for this course is that in order to fully understand the implications of diversity for organizations you must personally confront issues having to do with power, privilege, stereotypes, identity, and discrimination. Toward this end, we will adopt an experiential approach whenever possible. Writing assignments will include a mix of personal reflections and scholarly analysis.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: ILRHR
