Various works of science fiction, horror, fantasy, and thrillers, will be drawn from to introduce the subject of host manipulation and control. Discussed will be parasites modifying host behaviors to: protect themselves, change their host's attractiveness to a mate, make the host more attractive to predators, make the host easier to catch by predators, fooling the host into taking care of the parasite's young instead of its own, changing the gender of the host to make it the appropriate parent for its young, etc. Scientific examples of the manipulations used in literature will be presented in relation to the stories presented.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Winter, summer.","catalogComments":"The course will be presented as 13 video captured lectures (about 45 minutes each) that are designed to immediately follow the student's having listened to a recorded reading or video selection from a movie representing the fictional theme based upon the facts that will follow.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Explore host-parasite relationships at the organismal and population level.","Integrate scientific knowledge with popular media.","Apply basic biology to creative story presentation.","Develop an appreciation of the marked diversity of life forms on planet earth along with their manifest interactions."],"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG"},{"strm":2629,"crseId":367903,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"BIOMS","catalogNbr":"1311","titleShort":"Parasites & Mummies","titleLong":"Paleoparasitology of Egypt and North Africa","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1143,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"06/01/2016","endDt":"06/24/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"ddb3","firstName":"Dwight","middleName":"Douglas","lastName":"Bowman"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Online Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

This branch of science began more than 100 years ago with the discovery of the eggs of the human blood fluke, a schistosome, in histologic sections of tissues from organs of Egyptian mummies. The work expanded in modern times as it became associated both with archaeology and paleoanthropology. Much of the research today utilizes minimally invasive methods to examine ancient remains and is aided greatly by new molecular approaches. The course will examine the different methodologies and findings that have been unearthed in Ancient Egypt and north Africa in natural and manmade mummified remains of humans and animals and through the careful examination of different archaeological sites.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Winter, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Ability to identify major periods of larger north African civilization since about 4000 BCE.","Categorization of characters important in the preservation of paleoparasitologic samples.","Capability of listing and briefly describing how various techniques involving radiology, ultrasound, microscopy, immunologic, and molecular methods can answer very direct questions about samples thousands of years old.","Capability of describing several parasitic diseases of ancient peoples and how these diseases were acquired.","Develop an appreciation as to how easily great deal can be learned about ancient civilizations through the tools of utilized by paleoparasitologists and related disciplines."],"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG"},{"strm":2629,"crseId":363619,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"BIOMS","catalogNbr":"3350","titleShort":"Wildlife Parasitology","titleLong":"Wildlife Parasitology","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1146,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"06/27/2016","endDt":"08/05/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"ddb3","firstName":"Dwight","middleName":"Douglas","lastName":"Bowman"},{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"al33","firstName":"Araceli","middleName":"","lastName":"Lucio-Forster"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Online Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.
