In this course students will debate the difference between \"charity\" and \"participation\" and develop their own notions about how to lead a \"good life\" by serving others.

This Urban Semester course is organized to inform students about this part of New York City as an iconic example of how life is lived among people who experienced the socioeconomic developments of the City since the departure of manufacturing, white ethnic abandonment, the repopulation of the area by people of color and their struggle to sustain their communities of color during the current era of gentrification.  Students will engage people in the community that is most vulnerable to displacement and come to understand their circumstances by participating with members of community-based organizations. In this course students will debate the difference between \"charity\" and \"participation\" and develop their own notions about how to lead a \"good life\" by serving others. The experiences students have in North Brooklyn serve to inform them about how disparities are lived in as a real-world experience.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-CEL, CU-SBY, CU-UGR)","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: acceptance to New York City Urban Semester required.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"HE","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":364791,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"HE","catalogNbr":"4921","titleShort":"Exp Based Learning","titleLong":"Experience Based Learning in Corporate and Public Sector Internships","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"040","classNbr":14487,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sb43","firstName":"Sam","middleName":"","lastName":"Beck"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in NYC."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"HENYC","locationDescr":"Human Ecology in NYC","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":5,"unitsMaximum":5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"In this Urban Semester Course, students learn through a cycle of experience and reflection.  Over the course of the semester, students learn how to implement experience-based learning techniques and perspectives to enhance their competencies as initiates of professional practice in careers of their choosing.  One day each week, the students have discussions with professionals who represent different aspects of the New York City economy.  This exposure enables students to explore a variety of professional perspectives and practices.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-CEL, CU-SBY, CU-UGR)","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: acceptance to New York City Urban Semester required.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"HE","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":364792,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"HE","catalogNbr":"4922","titleShort":"City and Community Engagement","titleLong":"Immersion in the City and Community Engagement","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"040","classNbr":14488,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sb43","firstName":"Sam","middleName":"","lastName":"Beck"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in NYC."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"HENYC","locationDescr":"Human Ecology in NYC","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":5,"unitsMaximum":5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The world of work and professional practice does not function in isolation to the society in which we live.  Therefore it is important to contextualize work experience with a more engaged role in the life of urban communities around us.  Community Action Inquiry provides a lens through which to understand the conditions and disparities that surround us in New York City.  Each semester, students work with residents and leadership within an urban neighborhood to investigate an issue of importance identified by the community, and co-construct solutions that they can act upon and learn from.

nature of service and leadership as integral to all forms of practice, whether in a professional public health career or in a leadership role in personal and community life.  Service is a way of being in practice in all parts of our lives, rather than a community activity or act of charity that is seen as an adjunct to 'real life work.'  Service and leadership are considered in different health care contexts:  New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, hospitals and clinics, senior citizen organizations, transitional homeless housing sites, federal, state and local public health agencies, and community based health programs.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall,
