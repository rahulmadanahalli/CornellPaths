of society (e.g., population, the economy) and the sweeping changes that have occurred within them over the past couple of centuries.  Particular attention will be paid to changes in social cohesion, the division of labor, the spatial organization of society, and technology. These theories, which are covered in the first two segments of the course, provide some insight into where society is going and what challenges have emerged along the way.  In the third segment of the course, we will look more closely at the role of individuals and everyday interaction in the genesis of social phenomena.  We will explore theories about what motivates individuals' social behavior, the role of rationality and emotion, how the micromechanics of interpersonal contact can shape larger society, and the subtle links between biological and social processes.  In the final segment of the course, we will explore complex webs that emerge through social actors' connections to each other, and how these network structures have been shaped by the various processes that were examined during the semester.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"Forbidden Overlap: Students may not receive credit for both SOC 1101 and DSOC 1101.","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":359378,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"2090","titleShort":"Networks","titleLong":"Networks","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":7928,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dae3","firstName":"David","middleName":"","lastName":"Easley"},{"instrAssignSeq":11,"netid":"jmk6","firstName":"Jon","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Kleinberg"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"Statler Hall 185-Aud","bldgDescr":"Statler Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STL185","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"CS","catalogNbr":"2850","type":"B"},{"subject":"ECON","catalogNbr":"2040","type":"B"},{"subject":"INFO","catalogNbr":"2040","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This interdisciplinary course examines network structures and how they matter in everyday life.

The course mirrors HD 2580 \"Six Pretty Good Books,\" an introductory lecture course for entering students and students whose majors are outside the social and behavioral sciences. Both classes (2580 and 4580) will use the same set of readings, but the seminar format is a weekly 90-minute in-depth discussion rather than lecture. Most importantly, unlike 2580, 4580 is not about the books; rather, it is about how to teach the books.  Much of our in-class analysis of the books centers on identifying what are the key contributions to knowledge, as well as important limitations, and how best to communicate these ideas to students with little background in the social sciences. All students are provided the opportunity to lead one or more discussion groups in 2580.  In addition to facilitating metacognitive understanding of the books, the seminar has two additional goals: 1) to provide advanced undergraduates with an opportunity to summon, integrate, and apply insights that they have acquired over the course of their undergraduate education as they analyze arguments from the standpoint of multiple social sciences, and 2) to integrate scholarship across disciplinary lines, a major goal of University Courses.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"A University Course - This class highlights cross-disciplinary dialogue and debate.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: At least one statistics course.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment is limited to: majors in either Human Development, Psychology, Sociology, or Economics.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":351101,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"4780","titleShort":"Family & Society in Africa","titleLong":"The Family and Society in Africa","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":8602,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:35PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"na12","firstName":"N'Dri","middleName":"Therese","lastName":"Assie-Lumumba"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Africana Ctr B07","bldgDescr":"Africana Ctr","facilityDescrshort":"AFCB07","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"4606","type":"B"},{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"6066","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"\"The family, as a social institution, is structured according to historical, socio-economic, political, and cultural factors.

Methodological approaches include analysis of the distribution of adoption times, event history models of individual adoption, spatial correlation, simulation, and process tracing.
