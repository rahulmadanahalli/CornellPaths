Under our very noses, however, Native American history has evolved into one of the most exciting, dynamic, and contentious fields of inquiry into America's past. It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to \"unlearn\" about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting. As such, the course will provide numerous opportunities for students to develop their critical thinking and reading skills.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(D)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":365706,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"AIS","catalogNbr":"3560","titleShort":"Indigenous Philosophies","titleLong":"Thinking from a Different Place: Indigenous Philosophies","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16082,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"etc7","firstName":"Eric","middleName":"T.","lastName":"Cheyfitz"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Rockefeller Hall 189","bldgDescr":"Rockefeller Hall","facilityDescrshort":"RCK189","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3562","type":"C"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"3560","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The Western nation-state has failed to solve the two most pressing, indeed catastrophic, global problems: poverty and climate change.

As such, the course is generative for an understanding of (post)colonialism in the United States. We will study case law dealing withÂ  issues in the ongoing history of federal Indian law, which include sovereignty; criminal and civil jurisdiction; religious, cultural, and civil rights; and the legal parameters of Indian identity. Along with the case law, we will read literary, political, historical, ethnographic texts that will help us understand the fundamental cultural and political conflicts between Indians and Europeans embedded in the law, between kinship-based societies sharing communal land, and a society based in the twin structures of individualism and property.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AG"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":360403,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"AIS","catalogNbr":"6970","titleShort":"Independent Study in AIS","titleLong":"Independent Study in American Indian Studies","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":1268,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"tar37","firstName":"Troy","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Richardson"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Sign up under faculty member's section with prior faculty approval.
