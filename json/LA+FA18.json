methods of landscape research by \"exposing\" them to one of the most fragile, dynamic and desired landscapes at today's world: the coast.  Moreover, understanding the coast as a landscape of desire and conflict will help students to critically engage with what we think as an \"objective research methodology\".  The course will engage with concrete sites, preferably at the coast of the United
