Basic grammar and vocabulary are covered, including explanations of the fundamental parts of a sign, proper use of fingerspelling, and the significance of nonmanual features. Instruction is supplemented with videotexts allowing students to begin to explore the visual literature of the Deaf community in the United States-stories, poems, and jokes that are unique to Deaf culture. Readings and class discussions acquaint students with the causes of deafness, the historical development of ASL and its linguistic status, and characteristics of deaf education both throughout history and in the present day.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2594,"crseId":351444,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"LING","catalogNbr":"1170","titleShort":"Intro to Cognitive Science","titleLong":"Introduction to Cognitive Science","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1545,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"06/22/2015","endDt":"07/31/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"ci36","firstName":"Catalina","middleName":"","lastName":"Iricinschi"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"White Hall 106","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT106","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

Examines how intelligent information processing can arise from biological and artificial systems. Draws primarily from five disciplines that make major contributions to cognitive science: philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, and computer science. The first part of the course introduces the roles played by these disciplines in cognitive science. The second part focuses on how each of these disciplines contributes to the study of five topics in cognitive science: language, vision, learning and memory, action, and artificial intelligence.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(KCM-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"4-credit option involves writing section instead of exams.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"}]
