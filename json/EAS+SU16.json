Students will gain a depth of knowledge about the ocean and global warming to enable them to speak and write confidently about contemporary public issues regarding the health of the ocean, global warming and a sustainable future.

The goal of the course is to teach participants the skills needed to work independently to acquire data sets derived from a variety of satellite sensors (SeaWiFS, MODIS, AVHRR, SeaWinds and Topex-Poseidon) and to merge these data sets to examine biological response to changes in the physical environment. Course time is split equally between lectures and computer lab work. Lectures cover the fundamentals of bio-optics, pigment algorithms, primary production algorithms and the underlying physical principals leading to the measurement of sea surface temperature, ocean wind speed and ocean topography. Computer labs focus on developing the Python programming skills needed to process, analyze and visualize satellite image data. See the course syllabus for more details on the topics covered in this course.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"EN"}]
