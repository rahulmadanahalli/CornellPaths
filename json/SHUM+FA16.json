What role have Islamized Armenians played in this debate, and how have their narratives underscored how gender was a central aspect of the Armenian Genocide? This course addresses the specific experiences of trafficked women and children who were subjected to forced Islamization.These practices of violent erasure will be examined within the context of the late Ottoman understanding of gender and slavery, and emerging Turkish nationalism which targeted Armenians for extermination through mass murder, enslavement, and forced assimilation.Assigned course materials include an interdisciplinary mix of scholarly readings, oral histories, novels, memoirs alongside print and visual media.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.

Philosophers often disembody meaning, but feminist and queer theory have intersected with philosophy to insist on the importance of what is (as Jeanette Winterson writes) \"written on the body\"—inscribed on and as the skin. In theology, some readings of the Hebrew Bible see skin as a barrier between human and divine; others read skin color as a sign of divine dis/favor; still others worry about wounds and other stigmata. We will look at ways that skin is \"marked\" as readable, and at modes in which this is valued or disvalued, how it stigmatizes or registers as blank.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.
