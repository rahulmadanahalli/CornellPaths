It focuses on such topics as human subjects protection, working with populations across the lifespan (e.g., children, seniors), database development, working with external partners and stakeholders (e.g., schools, hospitals), and basic concepts and techniques in decision research. Students participate in weekly laboratory meetings in small teams focused on specific projects as well as monthly meetings in which all teams participate. During laboratory meetings, students discuss ongoing research, plans for new studies, and interpretations of empirical findings from studies that are in progress or have been recently completed. New students work closely with experienced students and eventually work more independently. In order to fully grasp how the research projects fit into the broader field, students read relevant papers weekly and write reaction responses. Because several projects are ongoing at all times, students have the opportunity to be involved in more than one study and are assigned multiple tasks such as piloting research paradigms, subject recruitment, data collection, data analysis, and data entry.

Â Much of our in-class analysis of the books centers on identifying what are the key contributions to knowledge, as well as important limitations, and how best to communicate these ideas to students with little background in the social sciences.Â All students are provided the opportunity to lead one or more discussion groups in 2580. Â In addition to facilitating metacognitive understanding of the books, the seminar has two additional goals: 1) to provide advanced undergraduates with an opportunity to summon, integrate,Â and apply insights that they have acquired over the course of their undergraduate education as theyÂ analyze arguments from the standpoint of multiple social sciences, and 2)Â to integrate scholarship across disciplinary lines, a major goal of University Courses.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"A University Course - This class highlights cross-disciplinary dialogue and debate.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: At least one statistics course.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment is limited to: majors in either Human Development, Psychology, Sociology, or Economics.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"HE"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":363100,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"HD","catalogNbr":"4590","titleShort":"Transitions Across Life Span","titleLong":"Transitions Across the Life Span","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":14518,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"cel72","firstName":"Corinna","middleName":"E.","lastName":"Loeckenhoff"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Human Ecology Building 201","bldgDescr":"Human Ecology Building","facilityDescrshort":"HEB201","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Seminar-style course on major normative and non-normative transitions that people encounter from late adolescence to advanced old age.

The nature of temperament and personality is explored from psychometric, experiential, genetic, and neurobiological points of view. There is a focus on the general role played by the biogenic amines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin), neuropeptides (corticotrophin releasing hormone, opiates, oxytocin), genetic polymorphisms in these neuromodulators, and early experience in determining individual differences in temperament and personality.

The manner in which experience enduringly affects neurobiological functioning via epigenetic processes is considered. The manner in which the resulting neurobiological functioning influences the encoding of subsequent experience is explored as the basis of stability in emotional behavior.
