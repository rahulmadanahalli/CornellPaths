From 1914-1945, the continent witnessed an extraordinary entanglement of inter-state wars, revolutions and counter-revolutions, civil wars and genocides.  Originating as a classical inter-state conflict, the Great War led to a Weltanschaungskrieg. In spite of its highly controversial uses, the concept of \"European Civil War\" is probably the must useful in order to sum up such an \"age of  extremes\" in which wars have no rules: they become wars against civilians, politics makes groups into implacable enemies and an endemic violence deeply reshaped both cultures and collective imagination. This course will analyze some features of this cataclysmic time by engaging political theory, cultural and intellectual history.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Conducted in English.  Co-meets with ROMS 6550.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366995,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"ROMS","catalogNbr":"4944","titleShort":"Biopolitics","titleLong":"Biopolitics","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16702,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"nd326","firstName":"Naminata","middleName":"","lastName":"Diabate"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"agt24","firstName":"Antoine","middleName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Traisnel"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 394","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH394","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4944","type":"C"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4944","type":"C"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6944","type":"C"},{"subject":"ROMS","catalogNbr":"6944","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course explores the philosophical concept of biopolitics and its diverse translations and/or adaptations across multiple disciplines and across the globe (Africa, Far East, South East Asia, and the Americas).

Throughout the semester, we shall examine 1. the innovative thinking around biopolitics in the works of Arendt, Esposito, Agamben, Hardt and Negri, 2. the connections and entanglements of the concept with postcolonial theory in Mbembe, Samaddar, Sakai, Mezzadra, 3. the extension and complication of biopolitical logistics over to non-human bodies in Uexküll, Sloterdijk, Wolfe, Shukin. Additionally, we will examine theorizations of new stylistics of power as well as emerging forms of agency and political organizing in the biopolitical sphere. Key terms include race, postcoloniality, animality, capture, embodiment, agency, technology.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with COML 6944/ROMS 6944.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":359117,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ROMS","catalogNbr":"5070","titleShort":"Romance Lang Learn &Teach","titleLong":"Methodology of Romance Language Learning and Teaching","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":5838,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Morrill Hall 111","bldgDescr":"Morrill Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MRL111","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This is the mandatory course for graduate students wishing to TA in Romance Studies."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/UnSat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory - Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Focuses on language teaching as facilitation of learning, thus on the learner's processing of language acquisition and the promotion of reflective teaching.

Readings will be organized around three specific problems: (1) how secularism was employed in early, Modern Europe to determine the relationship between the native colonial subject's body, mind, and soul and enslavement; (2) how bodily consciousness and \"unconscious\" resistance (ranging from armed resistance to sports and dance) have been articulated as tools for struggling against various kinds of oppression; and (3) how anti-universalist claims emerged as political necessity for rectifying the relations between body and mind in the Caribbean's emancipatory discourses. We will read texts by Aristotle, Shakespeare, Hegel, Judith Butler, W.E.B. DuBois, C.L.R. James, McGary and Lawson, Elaine Scarry, Kamau Brathwaite, Césaire, Fanon, Sylvia Wynter, Glissant, Hortense Spillers, Paul Gilroy, and others.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366996,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"ROMS","catalogNbr":"6944","titleShort":"Biopolitics","titleLong":"Biopolitics","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16703,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"nd326","firstName":"Naminata","middleName":"","lastName":"Diabate"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"agt24","firstName":"Antoine","middleName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Traisnel"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 394","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH394","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4944","type":"C"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4944","type":"C"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6944","type":"C"},{"subject":"ROMS","catalogNbr":"4944","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course explores the philosophical concept of biopolitics and its diverse translations and/or adaptations across multiple disciplines and across the globe (Africa, Far East, South East Asia, and the Americas). We will trace the concept of biopolitics and its attendant notions-Biopower, Sovereignty, Governmentality-as they emerge in the work of Michel Foucault and analyze the multiple disciplinary and geographical directions in which they have travelled. Throughout the semester, we shall examine 1. the innovative thinking around biopolitics in the works of Arendt, Esposito, Agamben, Hardt and Negri, 2. the connections and entanglements of the concept with postcolonial theory in Mbembe, Samaddar, Sakai, Mezzadra, 3. the extension and complication of biopolitical logistics over to non-human bodies in Uexküll, Sloterdijk, Wolfe, Shukin. Additionally, we will examine theorizations of new stylistics of power as well as emerging forms of agency and political organizing in the biopolitical sphere. Key terms include race, postcoloniality, animality, capture, embodiment, agency, technology.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with COML 4944/ROMS 4944.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"}]
