To what extent should genetic engineering of crop plants be permitted? Should we place limits on fossil fuel consumption as a means of limiting global warming and global climate change? Must human endeavors be restricted in certain areas to maintain diversity? The format of this course is interactive, with lectures and discussions about how we as a society deal with controversial issues.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA) (PBS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, summer.
