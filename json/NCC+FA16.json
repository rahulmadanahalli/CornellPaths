The course will rely primarily on the case method to examine how student beliefs and decisions hold up to the scrutiny of critical thinking, analysis, and relevant research from across the social sciences. Students will be exposed to the best available research evidence so they leave the course with an appreciation for the science that can guide their approach to leading others. To facilitate development as a leader, Principled Leadership also requires students to personalize course concepts by engaging in a number of assessments, self-reflections, and exercises and to practice important leadership skills such as issue selling and responding to crises.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Johnson School core course.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Limited enrollment.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":350805,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NCC","catalogNbr":"5500","titleShort":"Financial Accounting","titleLong":"Financial Accounting","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13239,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":24,"netid":"mbs242","firstName":"Margaret","middleName":"B.","lastName":"Shackell"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B10","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB10","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***NON JOHNSON GRAD AND UG SENIORS ONLY***\nNon-Johnson Students ONLY:  August 16th at 8:00am to September 6th at 4:00pm.
