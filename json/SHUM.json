Drawing from writings in continental philosophy and phenomenology, the challenge of the class will be to inquire into how sensation in particular broadens notions of citizenship and politics. How do accounts of sensation in political theory reconceive citizenship? What are possible conceptual practices for unraveling normative, colonial, and authoritarian definitions of the political subject? What is the place of sensation in theories of relationality? Students will also be asked to critique the terms under which citizenship is constrained, defined, and regulated. In addition, the course will examine how accounts of sensation delineate traces and figures excluded from the rights conferred by organized polities. In order to account for those excluded from citizenship, the seminar will also consider the role of sight, touch, and imagination in the public realm or, as Hannah Arendt writes, \"namely, the faculty of seeing things not only from one's own perspective but from that of all others who are present.\" Facing the challenge of Arendt's words, the course will reflect on the implications of critique, judgment, and phenomenology for democratic theory in general. Discussions may, for example, seek to uncouple the rhetoric of sovereignty and law from citizenship. Finally, we will ask what a study of sensation provides for redressing and/or accounting for dispossession. As students will be encouraged to integrate their research interests with course reading, topics may include questions of how philosophies of anarchism, civil disobedience, feminism, queer theory, and decolonization broaden ideas of citizenship and political ethics.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":366513,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SHUM","catalogNbr":"4992","titleShort":"Affective Ecologies","titleLong":"Affective Ecologies","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16618,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"dl36","firstName":"Dana","middleName":"Marie","lastName":"Luciano"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"A D White House 109","bldgDescr":"A D White House","facilityDescrshort":"ADW109","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4026","type":"C"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"4992","type":"C"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4992","type":"C"},{"subject":"LGBT","catalogNbr":"4992","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar considers the points of intersection between theories of affect, emotion, and sexuality in recent queer and feminist thought, and the set of critical and cultural developments that has come to be called the \"nonhuman turn.\" We will explore contemporary critical attention to the agential, sensory and cognitive capacities of the non-human, considering how this body of work reconfigures the relations between human and nonhuman worlds, and the more flexible and nuanced accounts of \"nature\" and \"environments\" that they make possible.

Primary texts include Devi's \"Draupadi,\" Ngugi's Wizard of the Crow, Andersen's The Emperor's New Clothes, Tennyson's \"Godiva,\" Auden's \"Cave of Nakedness,\" videos of Femen, gay parades, and Occupy Wall Street. You will read these visual and literary texts in conjunction with theoretical reflections on shame/injury, exposure, and humanity by Freud, Foucault, Derrida, Levinas, Nancy, and Berger.

When architecture is understood as an organism, and the skin and structure of architecture as a system, the conflation of structure into the skin is a way of thinking of the architectural enclosure as a deep skin, and the individual parts of which an architectural skin is constructed, as a study of the tissue of structure. This seminar will  engage these ideas across a wide range of disciplines and topics including: the specular/reflecting skin, mediatic skins, metabolism and megastructures, the digital skin, the new grotesque, and Big Data and networked skins.

In doing so, we will investigate how blackness is contingent on the specifics of its historical, social, and cultural production and, yet, open to multiple and competing claims. Therefore, blackness here is less a stable racial category than theoretical motor, operated by moving and contested discourses, histories, images, meanings, and performances by Black subjects. Focusing on Black skin representation and discourses of blackness as a cultural signifier, students will watch and discuss important representations and misrepresentations of blackness on screen.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.

Drawing upon critical theory, media history, and specific artistic and scholarly projects in old and new media, the course asks how and why Joyce came to be used as a defining figure of the \"golden age\" of hypertext theory: both an exemplary artist and an ultimate editorial challenge. Of special interest to the course is the fate of scholarly projects that took Joyce as their subject, for the challenges of sustainability that the first wave of digital scholarly projects encountered—challenges that reflect on more general problems of preservation in the digital environment, like data corruption, memory failures, and link rot—give rise to important questions about loss, failure, and memory in the history of the digital humanities. Themes that the course explores include hypertext theory, poststructuralist theory, electronic scholarly projects, histories of computing, histories of the book, concepts of the \"social text,\" and the history of predictions about the fate of traditional written forms in an electronic world. Authors and works include James Joyce, Marshall McLuhan, Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, George Landow, Jay David Bolter, Hans Walter Gabler, Michael Groden, Jerome McGann, and interactive digital texts.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.

But what happens to the authority of a text when its author is unknown? The proposed seminar combines methods derived from the history of the book, literary studies, and cultural and social history in exploring this question. As one might expect, there is no singular answer. Cases will be examined in which authorial evasiveness or reticence undermine the authority of a text while other cases will illustrate how authority has been enhanced by anonymity or anonymous contributions (one thinks, for example, of blind peer review in an academic context). Furthermore, the course will also go beyond the domain of the text by examining authority and anonymity in non-textual contexts.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.

The texts we will examine and elaborate on a political distinction between a human \"interior\" of \"culture\" or \"reason\" and a non-human \"exterior\" made of \"natural\" processes that are indifferent to human life. We will examine theoretical critiques of the old political notion that the authority of rulers should be like that of architects: leaders are recognized by their capacity to build interior spaces that nourish human modes of living. We will consider a range of cases in which political projects designed to build all-encompassing interiors have exposed humans and non-humans alike to the possibility of outright destruction. In some cases, authorities are recognized as such due to their perceived capacity to expose themselves and their followers to the possibility of annihilation.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.
