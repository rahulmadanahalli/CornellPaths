Population-genetic (including quantitative-genetic), static optimization, dynamic programming, and game-theoretic methods are emphasized. These approaches are illustrated by application to problems in optimal foraging, sexual selection, sex ratio evolution, animal communication, and the evolution of cooperation and conflict within animal social groups. Students learn to critically assess recent evolutionary theories of animal behavior, as well as to develop their own testable models for biological systems of interest or to extend preexisting models in novel directions.

This course will read literature and discuss how these networks drive flexible behavior, at a cellular level of analysis. Topics include: using combinations of ion channels to build neurons with different firing properties; principles of network connectivity; mechanisms shaping different components of the behavior (ex., intensity, phasing, rhythm); modulatory inputs and plasticity mechanisms driving variable output from an anatomically fixed network; and evolution of neural networks.
