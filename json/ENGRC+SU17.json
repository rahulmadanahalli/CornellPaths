They communicate using various types of documents (e.g., emails, memos, problem analyses, proposals, progress reports), give oral presentations, and incorporate graphics in their oral and written work. Students learn how to communicate specialized information to different audiences (e.g., technical and nontechnical audiences, colleagues and clients, peers and supervisors, and in-house departments), work in teams, and address organizational and ethical issues.
