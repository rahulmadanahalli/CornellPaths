presentations. Assignments are usually set in the context of a simulated law office (or judge's chambers). In the fall semester, students write predictive memoranda that point out the strengths and weaknesses of their client's case. To prepare the memoranda, students may need to determine the facts of the case by conducting interviews or depositions. Acting as junior attorneys, students will also make an oral presentation to a supervising attorney. The spring semester focuses on persuasive advocacy. Students prepare a memorandum, motion, or brief for submission to a court and, later, orally argue for their positions in a simulated court session. Throughout the year, students also learn the fundamentals of legal research. Instruction occurs not only in full-class sessions but also in individual conferences. Students receive extensive feedback on each major assignment.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring (yearlong).","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":350053,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"5090","titleShort":"Advanced Financial Stat Analy","titleLong":"Advanced Financial Statement Analysis","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18171,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:55AM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"10/12/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":8,"netid":"kjm267","firstName":"Kenneth","middleName":"Joe","lastName":"Merkley"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B10","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB10","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"10/12/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Graded(GRI)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5090","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"10/12/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"002","classNbr":18172,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"10/12/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":8,"netid":"kjm267","firstName":"Kenneth","middleName":"Joe","lastName":"Merkley"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"10/12/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Graded(GRI)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5090","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"10/12/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"003","classNbr":18173,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"10/12/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":8,"netid":"kjm267","firstName":"Kenneth","middleName":"Joe","lastName":"Merkley"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"10/12/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Graded(GRI)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5090","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"10/12/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"}],"description":"This course builds on the material of NBA 5060 and focuses on more advanced financial statement topics and specialized industries.

Students will participate in a semester-long colloquium and conference series on law and culture in East Asia in which Cornell faculty and guest speakers from around the world will present new research on current legal issues in the region.

In approaching these questions, the course draws on diverse historical, judicial, administrative, and policy materials.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: Constitutional Law.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the writing requirement.","catalogPermission":"Limited enrollment.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":364767,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7314","titleShort":"Int'l Law/Relat.

These concerns arise sharply in the context of the inclusion of social and economic rights in a constitution that is to be interpreted and enforced by the courts. Is the enforcement of these rights by courts undemocratic? Does the inclusion of these rights in a constitution force courts to violate the principle of the separation of powers because in the course of adjudicating on these rights courts are invariably required to make decisions that have implications for the allocation of resources and the formulation of policy? Do courts have the institutional competence to make decisions that are polycentric in nature? To lay foundation for exploring these concerns, the seminar will consider (a) the foundation of social and economic rights; (b) the emergence of the international regime on social and economic rights; and (c) various methods use in national legal systems to protect social and economic rights. The debate on the role of the judiciary in the enforcement of social and economic rights will be explored in the light of judicial experiences in countries such as India, South Africa, United States and Northern Ireland.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Limited enrollment.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":366034,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7394","titleShort":"Labor Migration & Trafficking","titleLong":"Labor Migration and Trafficking","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18711,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"06:05PM","timeEnd":"07:55PM","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ct343","firstName":"Chantal","middleName":"","lastName":"Thomas"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 277","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH277","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"A new, rapidly evolving body of international and domestic law focuses on human trafficking and human smuggling.

The seminar will include an introduction to multiple African legal systems, as well as African customary law, constitutional law, labor law, property law and family law. The seminar will examine the current law in the context of changes that have taken place in African society from colonization through the present day. Students will read cases and statutes from multiple African countries. Students will be encouraged to choose an area of law to conduct a comparative analysis in the required final paper. The seminar creates opportunities for multicultural experiences through immersion in South Africa's society and culture during a three-week winter trip to Johannesburg, South Africa, where students will receive instruction at the University of Johannesburg. (Travel assistance will be available based on demonstrated need. Please contact, Program Manager, IAD at 190 Uris Hall for more information.) The main objective of this aspect of the program is to enhance and reinforce academic learning by providing students the opportunity to actively engage with individuals and organizations directly involved in the administration of law in Africa in a variety of concentrations. The seminar will examine problems of law and how they have been addressed in Africa with particular attention to the interaction of the common law, African customary law, and other imported systems of law. Legal interaction between Africa and Europe, which began before colonial rule, intensified during the colonial period and has continued after independence. During the Colonial period, the Common Law and Civil law were imported into Africa and operated alongside customary law. The result is that pluralism of law is a common feature of legal systems in nearly all African states. The conflicts between the imported laws and customary law have generated considerable interest in reform and the integration of laws in various African countries as well as creating an opportunity to look to other legal system for alternative approaches.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367660,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7460","titleShort":"Lawyers in the Movies","titleLong":"Lawyers in the Movies","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18749,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ggm42","firstName":"Greg","middleName":"","lastName":"Murphy"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 387","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH387","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar will examine the influence film has had on how lawyers perceive themselves, and how society perceives lawyers, the legal profession, and the ethical standards of the legal profession.  We will study relevant scholarly material.  We will critique depictions of lawyers in films, lawyering, and the ethics of the profession as portrayed in film and television programs.  We will also spend time discussing trial techniques to be learned from the depictions of lawyers in movies.  This seminar will require each student to write independently a paper of at least 30 pages.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Rcommended prerequisite: previous completion of a basic trial advocacy course.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367659,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7597","titleShort":"Neoliberal Jurisprudence","titleLong":"Neoliberal Jurisprudence","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18748,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"wlb75","firstName":"Wendy","middleName":"Lynn","lastName":"Brown"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall G81","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTHG81","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"In this seminar, we will read selected cases, theory and analyses to study the precise mechanics involved and issues at stake in extending human rights to for-profit businesses and corporations.

In the context of Constitutional interpretation we will pay close attention to the rationale of constitutionalism, how it bears on constitutional interpretation, and how it explains the various ideological disputes between justices of the supreme court about the grounds and the legitimacy of their constitutional decisions. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367661,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7779","titleShort":"Theoretical Issues in Discr.","titleLong":"Theoretical Issues in Discrimination Law","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18750,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"06:05PM","timeEnd":"07:45PM","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jbg293","firstName":"John","middleName":"Blair","lastName":"Gardner"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 387","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH387","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"In this seminar, which lasts only until the midterm break (7 weeks), we will study a range of theoretical puzzles about the law regulating discrimination in employment, service-provision, education, and many other contexts. Our discussions will range across discrimination on grounds of sex, race, religion, sexuality, political viewpoint, and many other grounds. Examples will be taken from US constitutional law and from federal legislation, but also from the law of other jurisdictions. The seminar is about theoretical puzzles that cross the boundaries between different places and times and contexts, rather than about policy design or advocacy. Our puzzles will include: What exactly is wrong with discrimination, when it is wrong? Does the wrongness depend on the consequences? What makes a certain ground of discrimination an improper ground? Is it wrong to discriminate on such grounds in friendships, romantic relationships, etc. as well as in employment, schooling, etc.? Is indirect discrimination ('disparate impact') really a kind of discrimination? Is there any essential connection between discrimination and equality? Why is discrimination a suitable matter for legal regulation, rather than something to be left to private ethics or the market? As these sample questions suggest, we will not shy away from testing our most basic and cherished assumptions. Although there are no prerequisites, some knowledge of the Civil Rights Act 1964 (or similar legislation) would be an advantage. The seminar attracts 2 credits and meets the writing requirement.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":351869,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7781","titleShort":"Theories of Property","titleLong":"Theories of Property","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18717,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"gsa9","firstName":"Greg","middleName":"","lastName":"Alexander"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall G81","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTHG81","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar will provide an introduction to the most influential contemporary theories of property, as well as an opportunity to discuss how those theories might approach several important questions within property law.

Earlier that fall, the SS commandants, officers and guards who had been arrested by the British upon the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, had been tried before a British military tribunal. These were the first of numerous trials of Nazi war criminals and related criminal and civil proceedings arising out of the Holocaust. This seminar will examine legal and ethical issues raised in these and other trials of Nazi war criminals and individuals accused of collaborating with the Nazis in perpetrating crimes against humanity, including the 1947 \"Justice Trial\" of Nazi judges and senior officials of the Third Reich Ministry of Justice, the Eichmann Trial in Jerusalem and the 1963-64 Tel Aviv trial of Hersz Barenblat, the head of the Jewish police in the ghetto of Bedzin, Poland. The course will also examine the history of the Genocide Convention, and the developing law of genocide and crimes against humanity with respect to atrocities in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Darfur, including the evolving law on rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the professional responsibility writing requirement and the writing requirement.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":364872,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7805","titleShort":"Advanced Labor Law Clinic","titleLong":"Advanced Labor Law Clinic","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"CLN","ssrComponentLong":"Clinical","section":"301","classNbr":18719,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"abc49","firstName":"Angela","middleName":"B.","lastName":"Cornell"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["CLN"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The Advanced Labor Law Clinic provides students another opportunity to deepen their understanding of traditional labor and employment law by representing the interests of workers with typical workplace issues. There is no classroom component to this course.

Students may also have the opportunity to represent their clients in a case before the National Labor Relations Board, in mediation or arbitration pursuant to the dispute resolution mechanism in the collective bargaining agreement. In addition to the domestic labor law inquiries, interested students may have the opportunity to address international labor law topics as well. The international labor law work typically occurs in Latin America. During the semester, there will likely be two guest speakers and two panel discussions on timely labor law topics, which students will be required to attend, along with weekly meetings to discuss case preparation and advancement.
