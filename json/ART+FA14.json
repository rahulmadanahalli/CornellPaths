From installation, performance, video and conceptual practices of the 60's and 70's which explored the physical and ontological limits of art, to the \"Pictures\" and Post-Conceptual generation that problematized art institutions and cultural, political and economic realms, to present day project based and relational aesthetic practices that employ dialogue as a medium.
