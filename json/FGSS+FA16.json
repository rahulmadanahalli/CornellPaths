It will concentrate on selected themes such as modernity, nationalism, and colonization in order to encourage students to challenge preconceived assumptions about Middle Eastern women, discuss some of the many roles they have played in social change, and think comparatively about gender, history, and social life. Students will be introduced to a wide array of literature produced in Western Europe and elsewhere pertaining to the Middle Eastern societies and cultures for a critical analysis of how knowledge and discourses about gender roles had been constructed in the course of the nineteenth century. In addition, students will learn about the ways in which Islamic law and legal institutions defined and managed the issues in relation to women's status as well as sexuality and marriage as social institutions. We will investigate how historical and contemporary political and social forces such as nationalism, colonialism, and revolutions operated in the course of the twentieth century, shaping both women's movement and advocating for women's rights before the law, access to education and family issues. Finally, this course will introduce students to the debates on \"gender as a useful category\" by connecting it to the recent and growing scholarship on masculinity and queer studies in the Middle East. By doing so, we will analyze relationality of women, men, and transgender categories and their political and social implications in the past and the present.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":363785,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"2780","titleShort":"Pleasure and Danger","titleLong":"Body as Text: Pleasure and Danger","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16137,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mr283","firstName":"Masha","middleName":"","lastName":"Raskolnikov"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 142","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH142","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"BSOC","catalogNbr":"2781","type":"C"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"2780","type":"C"},{"subject":"LGBT","catalogNbr":"2780","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"We experience our bodies as so much a part of who we are that we take them for granted.

disrupting her life, through analysis of dreams, symptoms, bungled actions, slips of the tongue, and repetitive behaviors.  Freud finds that these apparently irrational acts and behavior are ordered by the logic of the fantasy, which provides a mental representation of a taumatic childhood experience and the effects it unleashes in the mind and body-effects he called drives.  As \"unbound\" energies, the drives give rise to symptoms, repetitive acts, and fantasmatic stagings that menace our health and sometimes threaten social coexistence, but that also rise to the desires, creative acts, and social projects we identify as the essence of human life.  Readings will include fundamental texts on the unconscious, repression, fantasy, and the death drive, as well as case studies and speculative essays on mythology, art, religion, and group psychology.  Students will be asked to keep a dream journal and to work on their unconscious formations, and will have the chance to produce creative projects as well as analytic essays.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(KCM-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":352843,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"3691","titleShort":"Race

Today, some of the most heated debates surrounding feminism, identity politics, and Black women are framed within the broad contours of hip hop. This course will explore how women are portrayed in hip hop music and culture, addressing women both as consumers and producers. We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and peripheral female artists use hip hop to affirm their sexual power, articulate Black feminism, and create spaces for their artistic expression. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, performance studies, and queer of color critique to complicate the ways in which women, gender, and sexuality are represented in hip hop music. While our analyses will center on music and on the United States, we will also consider art, fashion, and dance within Black, Latina, and Caribbean interactions with hip hop. The course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about Black women's conceptualizations of feminism? How can we apply early \"hip hop feminism\" to understand current debates about Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? What are the relationships between queer theory and hip hop studies? Does hip hop allow spaces for alternative femininities? How do Black girls use hip hop as a pedagogical tool? The course will also address broader questions related to representations of Black femininity, people of color in the media, gender and sexual identity construction.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":360371,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4460","titleShort":"Women in the Economy","titleLong":"Women in the Economy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":8740,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"fdb4","firstName":"Francine","middleName":"D.","lastName":"Blau"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 219","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS219","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ECON","catalogNbr":"3440","type":"C"},{"subject":"ILRLE","catalogNbr":"4450","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Examines the changing economic roles of women and men in the labor market and in the family.
