From installation, performance, video and conceptual practices of the 60's and 70's which explored the physical and ontological limits of art, to the \"Pictures\" and Post-Conceptual generation that problematized art institutions and cultural, political and economic realms, to present day project based and relational aesthetic practices that employ dialogue as a medium.

Special attention will be given not only to the literary sources that shaped art theory, practice, and criticism but also to important issues such as propaganda, the viewer's emotional engagement, and the artist's social status. The unity of the visual arts, rhetorical effects, artistic rivalry, scenic urbanism, the relation between art and poetry, the use of classical and \"bizarre\" vocabulary, the concept of pastoral, the representation of ecstasy, and the idealization of death will be some of the themes explored in this course.

Special attention will be given not only to the literary sources that shaped art theory, practice, and criticism but also to important issues such as propaganda, the viewer's emotional engagement, and the artist's social status. The unity of the visual arts, rhetorical effects, artistic rivalry, scenic urbanism, the relation between art and poetry, the use of classical and \"bizarre\" vocabulary, the concept of pastoral, the representation of ecstasy, and the idealization of death will be some of the themes explored in this course.

We will explore how the visions of urban and rural spaces reflect the evolving cultural, social and political fabric of a nation in a period of rapid and often traumatic historical change. The course will feature screening of films set in several Italian locations, from Rome to Milan, from Naples to Venice, from Sicily to the Apennines, and represent different moments of Italian contemporary history. We will take advantage of the unique opportunity to study this cinema while residing in Rome and traveling in Italy, through the experience of the real settings that have figured so prominently in Italian cinema. Each session consists of an in-class lecture and a film screening.

This genre makes use of a vast range of techniques including lighting, staging, styling, directing, crafting, scripting, and more.
