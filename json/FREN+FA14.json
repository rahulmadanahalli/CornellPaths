violence in the context of the work of René Girard (La Violence et le sacré).  We will raise the question of what makes this sort of violence so intractable, and what has fostered the continuity of religious conflict over such a long span of time.  For exampe, the ceremonial or ritualistic nature of this violence seems to give it an internal justification that is not subject to laws concerning human rights.  Then, we will examine how a range of authors throughout history represent this violence in critical fashion.  A number of texts present the impossibilty of representing extreme violence, raising the question of how events can be witnessed when the witnesses are dead or traumatized by them.  How can such extreme violence be represented or explained without being justified or rationalized?  We will examine how the presentation of violence as a spectacle raises the questions of personal responsibility in the context of large scale and ongoing violence, implicating also those who observe but who do not directly participate.  We will also consider Maalouf's Les Croisades vues par les arabes (as well as his Identités meurtriès), Joinville's La Vie de Saint Louis, Thêodore Agrippa d'Aubigné's Les Tragiques, Elie Wiesel's La Nuit, Gillo Pontecorvo's La Bataille d'Algers, Jean Genet's Les Paravents, Shoshana Felman and Dori Laub's Testimony, and Elaine Scarry's

We will consider women's veiling and unveiling during the Algerian War of Independence, and its political idealization by male writers and filmmakers, for example in Pontecorvo's La Bataille d'Alger. Next we will gaze at the harem bodies of Western fantasy, looking at how contemporary artists and writers question the violence implicit in works like Delacroix's Femmes d'Alger dans leur appartment. Through the films of Nadir Maknèche and Djamila Sharoui, we will journey alongside the body in road trips, expeditions for missing people and escape plots to the other side of the Mediterranean. Finally, we will spend some time with marginal figures who capture some of the tragicomic nature of their bodily restrictions: with homosexual bodies and bodies for sale in the bars, brothels and nightclubs of Algiers and Tunis; with a girl raised as a boy in Marrakech; and with an ex-Nazi who shows up in a remote Algerian village.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with FREN 6155.

how different authors use (often unbeknownst to them) the socio-sexual constraints of their time to destabilize those very constraints and by so doing opening up potentially new paradigms for

It is during those years, nevertheless, that the destruction of European Jews aroused an intellectual debate whose philosophical, political, and literary contributions constitute landmarks for contemporary culture and criticism.  The course will explore the reasons for such a discrepancy, reconstructing the steps of the integration of the Holocaust into our historical consciousness.  It will analyze some of the most significant attempts to think such a trauma made by German-Jewish exiles (Arendt, Adorno, Anders), the survivors of the Nazi camps (Améry, Levi, Celan, Antelme), as well as the public intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean (Sartre, Bataille, MacDonald,

and revisited-in a different light.  The defeated revolutions of the past century put into question a teleological vision of history, engendering the decline of Marxist historiography and the simultaneous appearance of memory, a previously ignored concept for interpreting the past.  Outlining a symbolic shift from Marx to Benjamin, this change has a melancholic flavor that permeates many expressions of contemporary Left culture (from movies and autobiographies to historical and philosophical essays).  On the other hand, the emergence of Postcolonialism reopened the debate on the Eurocentric roots of Marx's thought and stimulated a new approach to some classical Marxist thinkers and historians such as Gramsci and C.L.R. James.  Taking into account both classical and contemporary texts, the seminar will analyze a reconfigured relationship between history and memory in the Left culture of our post-utopian age.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Co-meets withCOML 6416/FREN 6435/GERST 6431/GOVT 6696/HIST 6234/ROMS 6430.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":364747,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"FREN","catalogNbr":"4680","titleShort":"\"Theaters of the Self\"","titleLong":"Theater in Seventeenth-Century France: Theaters of the Self","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16053,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mdg17","firstName":"Mitchell","middleName":"D.","lastName":"Greenberg"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 260","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH260","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"FREN","catalogNbr":"6680","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course examines the work of the three greatest playwrights of the 17th century (Corneile, Molière, Racine).

It is during those years, nevertheless, that the destruction of European Jews aroused an intellectual debate whose philosophical, political, and literary contributions constitute landmarks for contemporary culture and criticism.  The course will explore the reasons for such a discrepancy, reconstructing the steps of the integration of the Holocaust into our historical consciousness.  It will analyze some of the most significant attempts to think such a trauma made by German-Jewish exiles (Arendt, Adorno, Anders), the survivors of the Nazi camps (Améry, Levi, Celan, Antelme), as well as the public intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean (Sartre, Bataille, MacDonald, etc).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"co-meets with COML 4415/FREN 4415/GERST 4411/GOVT 4786/HIST

Its ideas, debates and controversies could be viewed-historicized and revisited-in a different light. The defeated revolutions of the past century put into question a teleological vision of history, engendering the decline of Marxist historiography and the simultaneous appearance of memory, a previously ignored concept for interpreting the past. Outlining a symbolic shift from Marx to Benjamin, this change has a melancholic flavor that permeates many expressions of contemporary Left culture (from movies and autobiographies to historical and philosophical essays). On the other hand, the emergence of Postcolonialism reopened the debate on the Eurocentric roots of Marx's thought and stimulated a new approach to some classical Marxist thinkers and historians such as Gramsci and C.L.R. James. Taking into account both classical and contemporary texts, the seminar will analyze a reconfigured relationship between history and memory in the Left culture of our post-utopian age.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with COML 4416/FREN 4435/GERST 4431/GOVT 4696/HIST 4234/ROMS 4430.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":364751,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"FREN","catalogNbr":"6680","titleShort":"\"Theaters of the Self\"","titleLong":"Theater in Seventeenth-Century France: Theaters of the Self","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16060,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mdg17","firstName":"Mitchell","middleName":"D.","lastName":"Greenberg"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 260","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH260","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"FREN","catalogNbr":"4680","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course examines the work of the three greatest playwrights of the 17th century (Corneille, Molière, Racine). We will attempt to answer the questions: Why was theater the privileged form of representation of the 17th century? What is the relation between political Absolutism and the theater? And finally why was this theater essentially a representation of familial conflict? In other words, why and how does the theater of the 17th century participate in the evolution of the \"modern\" subject, its socio-sexual constructions and its ideological elaboration?","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Conducted in French.
