International finance is different in two basic respects: (1) the existence of multiple currencies adds risk to investment and financing decisions; (2) when corporations and portfolio investors cross international borders, both problems and opportunities arise. This course focuses on these issues and highlights how finance theory can be extended to address them. Students apply the basic principles of international finance to a variety of problems. The course helps students understand the ideas and research results of international finance and adapt what they learn to the practical problems in the increasingly globalized business world. The first part of the course outlines exchange rate volatility, barriers to international capital flows, and the value of international diversification. The second part presents a variety of problems, examples, and applications from the three basic themes described in part one.

The projects are done by teams of students, typically four, supported by both the faculty and an experienced adviser. Lecture material covers the approach to structuring complex problems, conducting analytical work and developing conclusions and recommendations. Student teams are expected to communicate regularly with their clients and to have at least interim and final presentations. These experiential-learning projects will integrate the concepts and knowledge covered in the core courses and immersions as well as other fall electives. These client-critical projects typically incorporate the broad areas of strategy, operations, finance or marketing.

Topics include: (1) investor psychological bias and irrational trading behavior, and how to overcome our own biases in stock trading; (2) limits of arbitrage and the risk of leveraged convergence trading; (3) stock index market timing (and why market timing is far more important in emerging markets around the world than in the US); (4) typical behavioral finance approaches in constructing outperforming stock portfolios (including value, momentum, size, earnings quality, corporate governance, effects of short-sale constraint, and many other effects); (5) applying behavioral finance concepts to understanding China's stock market (as an example of emerging equity markets).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":365543,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6029","titleShort":"NYC Technology Trek","titleLong":"NYC Technology Trek","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13436,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"10/10/2014","endDt":"10/10/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"wds4","firstName":"Wesley","middleName":"","lastName":"Sine"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Trip Date: October 10th\r\nBY PERMISSION ONLY.

In particular, we study the fundamentals of commodity futures returns and momentum strategy on commodity investment, the carry trade and momentum strategy on currency investment, the volatility strategy on option investment. In addition to delivering trading strategies, we pay close attention to common risk factors behind these investment strategies. Special topics change from one year to another to reflect recent trends and practices in industry, and also the state-of-art research in academia.

How do scientists and entrepreneurs find and create market opportunities? Commercializing University Science and High Technology will tackle these issues and apply our learning to projects drawn from Cornell labs and local high-tech firms. This course is designed to help students identify, evaluate, and obtain control over technology opportunities. The course focuses on three themes: (1) the source, discovery, and evaluation of technological opportunities on a university campus; (2) increasing the efficiency of the innovation process to produce new technologies that satisfy customer needs; and (3) the different mechanisms available to appropriate returns from technology. The course uses readings, cases, and discussions with practitioners to examine this phenomenon. After completing this class, students will be familiar with basic principles related to technology entrepreneurship and will have gained a deeper understanding of the technology commercialization process at Cornell. The class will be composed of a select group of graduate students drawn from science, engineering, law, medicine, and the Johnson Graduate School of Business (enrollment is limited).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":361754,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6600","titleShort":"Corporate Social Responsibil","titleLong":"Corporate Social Responsibility","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15374,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"10/13/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dmr42","firstName":"Dana","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Radcliffe"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 134","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH134","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"**JOHNSON, GRAD AND UG SENIORS ONLY**\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students August 11th thru September 9th with an additional Add/Drop period beginning October 15th at 8:00am to October 21st at 4:00pm. \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  October 20th at 8:00am to October 21st at 4:00pm.

These initiatives, commonly viewed as efforts in \"corporate social responsibility\" (CSR), stem from the growing conviction-among senior executives as well as other stakeholders-that business must be \"part of the solution\" of problems that threaten communities and even the planet itself. At the same time, corporations are not charities, and corporate managers must strive (within legal and ethical constraints) to serve the interests of shareholders. Consequently, firms that engage in CSR must find ways to meet social needs and protect the natural environment that are in line with the companies' strategic goals. Drawing from the recent literature on CSR, this course uses articles and book excerpts to acquaint students with current ideas and best practices in the field. The readings are generally supplemented by at least one guest speaker from a leading corporate practitioner of CSR. Class discussion of case studies gives students the chance to analyze CSR challenges confronted by specific companies and to identify and critically evaluate possible responses to those challenges. A final project, assigned to two-person teams, entails students' developing recommendations-supported by detailed analysis-for a particular company in its pursuit of \"strategic CSR.\"","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":366853,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6610","titleShort":"Nonprofit Gov & Leadership","titleLong":"Nonprofit Governance and Leadership","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18025,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"09/08/2014","endDt":"09/08/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jeg68","firstName":"Joe","middleName":"","lastName":"Grasso"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"09/22/2014","endDt":"09/22/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jeg68","firstName":"Joe","middleName":"","lastName":"Grasso"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":3,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"10/06/2014","endDt":"10/06/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jeg68","firstName":"Joe","middleName":"","lastName":"Grasso"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":4,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"10/20/2014","endDt":"10/20/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jeg68","firstName":"Joe","middleName":"","lastName":"Grasso"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":5,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"11/03/2014","endDt":"11/03/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jeg68","firstName":"Joe","middleName":"","lastName":"Grasso"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":6,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"11/17/2014","endDt":"11/17/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jeg68","firstName":"Joe","middleName":"","lastName":"Grasso"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":7,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"12/01/2014","endDt":"12/01/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jeg68","firstName":"Joe","middleName":"","lastName":"Grasso"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Add/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students Â¿ August 11th at 8:00am to September 9th at 4:00pm.

Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more interdependent parties. The purpose of this course is to understand the theory and processes of negotiation as it is practiced in a variety of settings. It is designed to complement the technical and diagnostic skills learned in other courses. A basic premise is that while a manager needs analytical skills to develop optimal solutions to problems, he or she also needs a broad array of negotiation skills for these solutions to be accepted and implemented. The course highlights the components of an effective negotiation and teaches students to analyze their own behavior in negotiations. It is largely experiential, giving students an opportunity to develop their skills by participating in negotiations and integrating their experiences with the principles presented in the assigned readings and course discussions.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":350688,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6700","titleShort":"Becoming a Leader","titleLong":"Becoming a Leader","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15385,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:55AM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"10/13/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":9,"netid":"hll37","firstName":"Hannes","middleName":"","lastName":"Leroy"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B08","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB08","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"THIS SECTION FOR NON-JOHNSON GRAD AND UG SRS/JRS ONLY\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  August 11th thru September 9th with an additional Add/Drop period beginning October 15th at 8:00am to October 21st at 4:00pm.

In general, an organization cannot survive without the trust of numerous stakeholders, and ethical lapses destroy trust and threaten vital stakeholder relationships. In today's volatile and fiercely competitive business environment, a manager must be able to identify and effectively resolve ethical issues that inevitably arise in the pursuit of business (and career) objectives. This course is designed to enhance students' skills in moral reasoning as it applies to managerial decision making. It begins by examining normative concepts and principles that typically enter into moral reasoning, then uses those concepts and principles to analyze cases. Discussions are designed to help students understand the moral issues confronting the decision makers in the cases and explore how those issues might be addressed in ethically responsible ways.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":350704,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6730","titleShort":"Derivatives Securities Part I","titleLong":"Derivatives Securities Part I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15300,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"10/10/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":9,"netid":"pg297","firstName":"George","middleName":"","lastName":"Gao"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***GM, GRAD and UG SRS/JRS ONLY***.  \r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students Â¿ August 11th at 8:00am to September 9th at 4:00pm.

Taxes have a direct impact on cash flow and often divert 30 to 40 percent of the firm's pretax cash flow to the government, effectively making the government the single largest stakeholder in many firms. Having an understanding of taxation and how firms plan accordingly is important for just about any career path students choose, whether they will be an investment banker, venture capitalist, consultant, money manager, CFO, treasurer, controller, taking over a family-owned business, or an entrepreneur setting up a new business. Topics include tax planning fundamentals, corporate tax fundamentals, taxation of mergers and acquisitions, taxation of divestitures, international taxation, taxes and wealth planning.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: NCC 5000, NCC 5060.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":350031,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5020","titleShort":"Managerial Acctng & Reporting","titleLong":"Managerial Accounting and Reporting","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12948,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":11,"netid":"mbs242","firstName":"Margaret","middleName":"B.","lastName":"Shackell"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B08","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB08","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Open to GM, Grad, UG Srs and Jrs.\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 13th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.  \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  January 29th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.  \r\nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 4th with permission of the faculty.

The attitudes, values, and practices that prevail in their organizations induce otherwise ethical employees to take actions that violate widely shared norms of conduct. Such behavior can be costly-even disastrous-leading to ruined careers, tarnished corporate reputations, and legal liability for the individuals and their companies. In an environment where \"only results matter,\" it can be difficult for a new MBA or law school graduate to recognize the risks. If she does see the dangers, she may still find it hard to avoid them.Â  This course seeks to help MBAs and law students understand how a firm's culture, combined with common human tendencies, can tempt-or push-employees into unethical behavior. It also considers how employees can meet ethical challenges posed by their firms' cultures. Class sessions include discussion of case studies and readings reporting on relevant research in psychology and organizational behavior, as well as talks by noted guest speakers from the worlds of business, law, journalism, and academia. The grade in the course is based on class participation and on two written case analyses, including a final project.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":361612,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5150","titleShort":"Leadership Theory & Practice","titleLong":"Leadership Theory and Practice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12950,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mjh35","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Hostetler"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B10","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB10","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"05:45PM","timeEnd":"08:25PM","startDt":"03/16/2015","endDt":"03/16/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mjh35","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Hostetler"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***NON-JOHNSON GRAD and UG SENIORS ONLY***\r\n** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\r\nDeadline for Changing Grade Option: March 13th, 2015.\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Non-Johnson Students ONLY:  January 13th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.

It will examine various new developments in retailing and the application of operations management principles to these developments. It is recommended for students interested in careers in (1) Retailing and supply chain management, (2) Businesses like banking, consulting, and information technology that provide services to retailers, and (3) Manufacturing companies that sell their products through retailers. Retailing is not only a link in the supply chain, but also an important industry for a number of reasons. This industry, more than any other, is at the forefront of business changes since it directly connects with the consumer and generates demand for the rest of the economy. It is an intensely dynamic industry, with continuous changes in marketing channels, technology, and sourcing. It has gone through remarkable developments through history, and has often been an incubator for new business concepts. Currently, retailing is leading economic growth and transformation in emerging markets around the world, both through global sourcing and global marketing. In the US, retailing comprises 40% of the economy, and is the largest employer. Problems faced by retailers are shared by other firms in the economy, and retailers are often the dominant player in a supply chain. Thus, retailing is also academically interesting as a laboratory to learn and test concepts that may apply to other businesses. Various types of sophisticated data can be collected in retailing easier than in other industries. Performance can be measured accurately and rapidly. Managers in retailing can also change their strategies and product mix in relatively short periods of time. Finally, low entry and exit barriers magnify risks and rewards in this industry, so that we find firms with stellar growth as well those with a history of bankruptcies.

At the beginning of the simulation, each team develops a strategy, and before the results of the last decision have been determined, presents an analysis of its performance, lessons learned, and its strategy for the future in a \"board of directors\" meeting. The first course meeting is 4 hours to introduce the simulation and its mechanics as well as a discussion of company strategy. Future meetings are weekly for 2 hours which includes time for teams to review their performance and work on their company decisions. Grades are based on the value created for the company's shareholders (relative to other firms in the same industry), the team's strategy, and the instructor's evaluation of team's performance at the board meeting.

The first few class sessions look at a series of brief articles that attempt to advance arguments in favor of a particular business proposition, and students learn how to examine these arguments critically, including by evaluating the strength and limitations of the evidence presented and by identifying and articulating the best counter-arguments to the positions offered. The remainder of the course is spent applying these critical thinking skills to a set of business cases, using a Strategic Thinking Problem-Solving framework. By the end of the course, the goal is for students to be able to approach business problems in a systematic and critically thoughtful way, and to produce and communicate a problem solution that is well reasoned, well received by ultimate decision makers, and likely to be implemented with success by a group/organization that a student is leading.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":362024,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5920","titleShort":"Experience in Int'l Management","titleLong":"Experience in International Management","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"FLD","ssrComponentLong":"Field Studies","section":"001","classNbr":12962,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":9,"netid":"rjc89","firstName":"Richard","middleName":"Joseph","lastName":"Coyle"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":"South Africa"}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Trip Dates: 1/5/15 thru 1/18/15"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"South Africa"}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["FLD"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Sat -

Sessions will examine the constraints to entrepreneurs and the ways in which they obtain financing with a particular focus on venture capital and emerging markets. The course will use cases of successful entrepreneurs under the most difficult circumstances and will address entrepreneurship in a serious downturn and networking across borders. In addition to common issues related to starting a business and investing in it, the class will address issues not normally on the radar screen of U.S. entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. The course will draw on the experience of investors and entrepreneurs, cases prepared especially for this course, as well as findings reported in the research literature. This course is meant to be in part a practical guide to students who wish to be entrepreneurs outside the United States or to create cross-border businesses. It may be of interest to people working in entrepreneurial environments in other organizations or students who want to get involved in various forms of financing entrepreneurial ventures. Students may use the course to explore development of a business concept or plan outside (at least in part) the United States. There will be a particular concentration on Asia, the role of government in stimulating entrepreneurship and venture capital and the nitty-gritty issues of valuing young and private firms sharing profits, raising resources, and organizing and managing human resources.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: At least one finance or economics class.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":350427,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6010","titleShort":"Electronic Commerce","titleLong":"Electronic Commerce","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12964,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lvo2","firstName":"Levent","middleName":"V.","lastName":"Orman"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Open to GM, GR and Undergrad Students. \r\nNon-Johnson students may add themselves to the waitlists during their enrollment periods, however Johnson Students have priority into the classes and non-Johnsons will be enrolled: 1) IF seats are still available after Johnson students complete their enrollment period and 2) IF the instructor allows. \r\n** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\r\nDeadline to Change Grade Option: March 13th, 2015\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 13th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.  \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  January 29th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.  \r\nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 4th with permission of the faculty.

It created a new emphasis on information technologies and systems in management; led to the development of new technologies and new combinations of existing technologies to support management; and occasionally radically altered business practices and the role of management.

To manage supply chains effectively, one needs to develop the right product, coordinate information and material flows throughout the entire network and deliver the product at the right time at the right location. Since different supply chain partners may face different types of challenges and may have different objectives, it is difficult to coordinate information and material flows and even more difficult to entice these partners to collaborate. The goal of this course is to develop a better understanding of the challenges in managing supply chains. This course will be relevant for students considering careers in management consulting, general management and supply chain management.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: NCC 5080Â or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":350610,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6430","titleShort":"Managerial Spreadsheet Model","titleLong":"Managerial Spreadsheet Modeling","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":14924,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"03/13/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":9,"netid":"dcj2","firstName":"David","middleName":"C.","lastName":"Juran"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 257-Parker","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH257","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Non-Johnson students may add themselves to the waitlists during the enrollment periods, however Johnson Students have priority into the classes and non-Johnsons will be enrolled: 1) IF seats are still available after Johnson students complete their enrollment period and 2) IF the instructor allows.\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 13th at 8:00am to January 28th at Noon.  \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  January 27th at 8:00am to January 28th at 4:00pm.  \r\nYou may add or drop a first-half class after January 28th with permission of the faculty.

Three methods of valuation are introduced: intrinsic valuation, relative valuation by multiples using comparables, and contingent claims valuation, based on a real options approach. The rest of the course will be dedicated to understanding each of these methods in greater detail and more importantly, applying them to the valuation of actual companies. This will involve understanding in detail discounted cash-flow models and the many inputs required to build them; dividend discount models; the determination and use of relative-value multiples such as price/earnings and price/book value; and finally, how to apply option theory to specific problems in valuation. The course includes a special session on valuation approaches and challenges specific to venture capital and private-equity investing. This will include a discussion of topics such as required internal rates of return (IRRs), the effects of leverage on valuation, and issues relating to the valuation of high-growth startups.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":364725,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6590","titleShort":"Mgmt of Financial Institutions","titleLong":"Management of Financial Institutions","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15004,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:55AM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"03/16/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"nhp7","firstName":"Nate","middleName":"","lastName":"Peck"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B06","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB06","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"GM and Grad Students ONLY\r\n** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\r\nDeadline to Change Grade Option: March 27th, 2015\r\nAdd/Drop permitted for ONE WEEK ONLY after class begins!

In the past, some students from the Engineering, Hotel, AEM (Dyson) and ILR programs have also attended this course. Impactful business leaders appreciate the importance of consumer insights. Many strategic decisions - such as introducing a new product, repositioning an existing product, or deciding whether to extend an existing brand or to introduce a new brand - are pivoted on consumer insights. In this course I will discuss how managers can uncover behavioral insights and use those insights to shape product marketing strategy. The course will cover the following four topics: CONSUMER INSIGHTS (What is consumer insight? What research methods can be used to uncover consumer insights?), POSITIONING &amp; BRANDING (Can you do the financial analysis required for a marketing plan? Why is positioning so important? Which segment should you target? Can intangible brand associations influence market shares? Should you extend your brand?Â  How is brand value measured?), INNOVATION (Do you have to be a pioneer to successfully innovate? How can new product diffusion be modeled? Is your category lifecycle slow-and-long or fast-and-short? How to test a concept? How can you optimize the attributes of your new concept? How can you forecast the sales of the new product?), PRICING &amp; ADVERTISING (Will a higher price help or hurt your brand? Does share-of-voice predict market share?). Please note that there is a significant overlap between the material taught in this course and the Strategic Brand Management course (NBA 6240) taught by me in the Strategic Marketing Immersion program. Therefore students, who have already attended the Strategic Marketing Immersion course will not be allowed to enroll for this course.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":350671,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6650","titleShort":"Strat Mgmt of Tech & Innov","titleLong":"The Strategic Management of Technology and Innovation","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12970,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"05:40PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":11,"netid":"rll36","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"Louis","lastName":"Laperle"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Open to GM and Grad Students Only\r\nNon-Johnson students may add themselves to the waitlists during the enrollment periods, however Johnson Students have priority into the classes and non-Johnsons will be enrolled: 1) IF seats are still available after Johnson students complete their enrollment period and 2) IF the instructor allows.\r\n** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\r\nDeadline to Change Grade Option: March 13th, 2015\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 13th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.  \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  January 29th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.  \r\nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 4th with permission of the faculty.

This course is designed for students who may someday work in, consult for, and/or create firms whose primary product is fundamentally related to technology or innovation. The course typically includes both M.B.A. students and graduate students in science. It starts by examining how industries are transformed by new technologies and how these patterns of industrial change generate both opportunity and high rates of firm failure. We will then explore the questions: Why do some technology leaders fail? and How do technology innovators successfully take on and replace incumbent firms? This leads to an examination of internal management issues, focusing on the design of innovative organizations: designing reward systems, managing growth, overcoming resistance to change, and using organizational culture to promote innovation.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":350695,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6710","titleShort":"Business Ethics","titleLong":"Business Ethics","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":14989,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:55AM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"03/16/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dmr42","firstName":"Dana","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Radcliffe"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B06","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB06","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"GM, Grad and UG Seniors Only\r\nNon-Johnson students may add themselves to the waitlists during the enrollment periods, however Johnson Students have priority into the classes and non-Johnsons will be enrolled: 1) IF seats are still available after Johnson students complete their enrollment period and 2) IF the instructor allows.\r\nNon-Johnson students must see their college registrar regarding policies connected with adding/dropping a second half Johnson School class.

This course is designed to enhance students' skills in moral reasoning as it applies to managerial decision making. It begins by examining normative concepts and principles that typically enter into moral reasoning, then uses those concepts and principles to analyze cases.

In particular, you will be introduced to theories and processes of negotiation between people with very different assumptions and mindsets, such as negotiation between heads of offices in different national locations in the same organization, business executives working with their legal counsels to get a deal done, or managers working with their cross-border alliance partners. The course is designed to enhance the awareness of your assumptions and beliefs, and their impact on your dealing with different others. In addition, the course is designed to help students approach complex and often emotionally charged negotiations with confidence and resilience.

Topics considered here include swaps, credit derivatives, value at risk models, and systemic risk. Just as intermediation has moved from institutions to markets, the course follows a similar evolution in the topics studied over the course of the semester.

International finance is different in two basic respects: (1) the existence of multiple currencies adds risk to investment and financing decisions; (2) when corporations and portfolio investors cross international borders, both problems and opportunities arise. This course focuses on these issues and highlights how finance theory can be extended to address them. Students apply the basic principles of international finance to a variety of problems. The course helps students understand the ideas and research results of international finance and adapt what they learn to the practical problems in the increasingly globalized business world. The first part of the course outlines exchange rate volatility, barriers to international capital flows, and the value of international diversification. The second part presents a variety of problems, examples, and applications from the three basic themes described in part one. Spreadsheet assignments and a term project requiring data analysis develop research skills and illustrate academic concepts.

Unlike traditional finance theories, behavioral finance argues that some financial market phenomena can plausibly be understood only under the assumption that some market participants are not fully rational.

Topics include: (1) investor psychological bias and irrational trading behavior, and how to overcome our own biases in stock trading; (2) limits of arbitrage and the risk of leveraged convergence trading; (3) stock index market timing (and why market timing is far more important in emerging markets around the world than in the US); (4) typical behavioral finance approaches in constructing outperforming stock portfolios (including value, momentum, size, earnings quality, corporate governance, effects of short-sale constraint, and many other effects); (5) applying behavioral finance concepts to understanding China's stock market (as an example of emerging equity markets).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":365543,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6029","titleShort":"NYC Technology Trek","titleLong":"NYC Technology Trek","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18401,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:30PM","timeEnd":"09:00PM","startDt":"10/09/2015","endDt":"10/09/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"wds4","firstName":"Wesley","middleName":"","lastName":"Sine"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"08:00AM","timeEnd":"11:59PM","startDt":"10/10/2015","endDt":"10/10/2015","instructors":[],"pattern":"S","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":3,"timeStart":"12:00AM","timeEnd":"05:00PM","startDt":"10/11/2015","endDt":"10/11/2015","instructors":[],"pattern":"Su","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"By Permisson Only.

What special challenges face women as they transition from students to managers to leaders? What do the latest research findings offer to women who are seeking C-level positions and the organizations that want to benefit from more women leaders? In this course, we will take a multi-pronged approach to learning about women and leadership to better prepare students of both genders to lead in organizations that are now comprised of nearly 50% women. To do this we will analyze case studies of women leaders pulled from a range of industries. We will review the current state of empirical evidence about the status of women as leaders, investigate the barriers that have made it more difficult for women to reach the top of the business world, and consider ways in which individuals and organizations can overcome them. Guest speakers will share their experiences with the class. Finally, there will be time to engage in deep reflection about what students expect from their careers, as well as a chance to consider the pathways they must take to become effective and inclusive leaders in increasingly diverse organizations.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":364727,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6170","titleShort":"Emerging Technology Markets","titleLong":"Emerging Technology Markets","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17747,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"10/12/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rll36","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"Louis","lastName":"Laperle"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B09","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB09","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\nDeadline to Change Grading Option:  October 27th \nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students: August 10th thru September 8th with an additional Add/Drop period beginning October 14th at 8:00am to October 20th at 4:00pm. \nNon-Johnson Students:  October 19th at 8:00am to October 20th 4:00pm.

The course focuses on three themes: (1) the source, discovery, and evaluation of technological opportunities on a university campus; (2) increasing the efficiency of the innovation process to produce new technologies that satisfy customer needs; and (3) the different mechanisms available to appropriate returns from technology. The course uses readings, cases, and discussions with practitioners to examine this phenomenon. After completing this class, students will be familiar with basic principles related to technology entrepreneurship and will have gained a deeper understanding of the technology commercialization process at Cornell.

In general, an organization cannot survive without the trust of numerous stakeholders, and ethical lapses destroy trust and threaten vital stakeholder relationships. In today's volatile and fiercely competitive business environment, a manager must be able to identify and effectively resolve ethical issues that inevitably arise in the pursuit of business (and career) objectives. This course is designed to enhance students' skills in moral reasoning as it applies to managerial decision making. It begins by examining normative concepts and principles that typically enter into moral reasoning, then uses those concepts and principles to analyze cases. Discussions are designed to help students understand the moral issues confronting the decision makers in the cases and explore how those issues might be addressed in ethically responsible ways.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":350704,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6730","titleShort":"Derivatives Securities Part I","titleLong":"Derivatives Securities Part I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15821,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"10/11/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":13,"netid":"dh634","firstName":"Darien","middleName":"","lastName":"Huang"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***GM, GRAD and UG SRS/JRS ONLY***.  \r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students: August 10th at 8:00am to September 8th at 4:00pm.

First, we will further dig into options by discussing no-arbitrage bounds in option prices, American options, option trading strategies, implied volatilities, dynamic replications, and risk management through options. Second, we will explore corporate securities such as common equity, warrants, callable bond, puttable bond, and convertible bond. Finally, we will discuss credit risk and credit derivatives such as credit default swaps (CDS). We use real-world cases to illustrate important applications of derivatives.

Taxes have a direct impact on cash flow and often divert 30 to 40 percent of the firm's pretax cash flow to the government, effectively making the government the single largest stakeholder in many firms. Having an understanding of taxation and how firms plan accordingly is important for just about any career path students choose, whether they will be an investment banker, venture capitalist, consultant, money manager, CFO, treasurer, controller, taking over a family-owned business, or an entrepreneur setting up a new business. Topics include tax planning fundamentals, corporate tax fundamentals, taxation of mergers and acquisitions, taxation of divestitures, international taxation, taxes and wealth planning.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: NCC 5000, NCC 5060.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":350031,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5020","titleShort":"Managerial Acctng & Reporting","titleLong":"Managerial Accounting and Reporting","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12844,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":14,"netid":"rdg222","firstName":"Ryan","middleName":"","lastName":"Guggenmos"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B08","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB08","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Open to GM, Grad, UG Srs and Jrs.\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 19th at 8:00am to February 10th at 4:00pm.  \nNon-Johnson Students:  February 4th at 8:00am to February 10th at 4:00pm.  \nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 10th with permission of the faculty.

The attitudes, values, and practices that prevail in their organizations induce otherwise ethical employees to take actions that violate widely shared norms of conduct. Such behavior can be costly-even disastrous-leading to ruined careers, tarnished corporate reputations, and legal liability for the individuals and their companies. In an environment where \"only results matter,\" it can be difficult for a new MBA or law school graduate to recognize the risks. If she does see the dangers, she may still find it hard to avoid them.Â  This course seeks to help MBAs and law students understand how a firm's culture, combined with common human tendencies, can tempt-or push-employees into unethical behavior. It also considers how employees can meet ethical challenges posed by their firms' cultures. Class sessions include discussion of case studies and readings reporting on relevant research in psychology and organizational behavior, as well as talks by noted guest speakers from the worlds of business, law, journalism, and academia. The grade in the course is based on class participation and on two written case analyses, including a final project.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":361612,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5150","titleShort":"Leadership Theory & Practice","titleLong":"Leadership Theory and Practice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12846,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"03/03/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mjh35","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Hostetler"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B10","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB10","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"05:15PM","timeEnd":"08:05PM","startDt":"02/08/2016","endDt":"02/08/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mjh35","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Hostetler"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":3,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"03/10/2016","endDt":"03/24/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mjh35","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Hostetler"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":4,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"04/07/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mjh35","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Hostetler"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B06","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB06","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***NON-JOHNSON GRAD and UG SENIORS ONLY***\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Non-Johnson Students ONLY:  January 19th at 8:00am to February 10th at 4:00pm.

Retailing is not only a link in the supply chain, but also an important industry for a number of reasons. This industry, more than any other, is at the forefront of business changes since it directly connects with the consumer and generates demand for the rest of the economy. It is an intensely dynamic industry, with continuous changes in marketing channels, technology, and sourcing. It has gone through remarkable developments through history, and has often been an incubator for new business concepts. Currently, retailing is leading economic growth and transformation in emerging markets around the world, both through global sourcing and global marketing. In the US, retailing comprises 40% of the economy, and is the largest employer. Problems faced by retailers are shared by other firms in the economy, and retailers are often the dominant player in a supply chain. Thus, retailing is also academically interesting as a laboratory to learn and test concepts that may apply to other businesses. Various types of sophisticated data can be collected in retailing easier than in other industries. Performance can be measured accurately and rapidly. Managers in retailing can also change their strategies and product mix in relatively short periods of time. Finally, low entry and exit barriers magnify risks and rewards in this industry, so that we find firms with stellar growth as well those with a history of bankruptcies. We shall study all these different aspects of retail operations through case discussions and lectures.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":350106,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5240","titleShort":"Macroeconomics & Int'l Trade","titleLong":"Macroeconomics and International Trade","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12995,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"03/18/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"oh33","firstName":"Ori","middleName":"","lastName":"Heffetz"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B05","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB05","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"GM and Grad ONLY.

The Cornell Management Simulation elective course will give you the chance to form a team and run a company that will compete against your classmates in a simulated industry. At the beginning of the simulation, each team develops a strategy, and before the results of the last decision have been determined, presents an analysis of its performance, lessons learned, and its strategy for the future in a \"board of directors\" meeting. The first course meeting is 4 hours to introduce the simulation and its mechanics as well as a discussion of company strategy. Future meetings are weekly for 2 hours which includes time for teams to review their performance and work on their company decisions. Grades are based on the value created for the company's shareholders (relative to other firms in the same industry), the team's strategy, and the instructor's evaluation of team's performance at the board meeting. The course may be taken for a grade or pass/fail at the student's option.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":350305,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5730","titleShort":"Leading from the Inside-Out","titleLong":"Leading from the Inside-Out","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16286,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"05:40PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ccs7","firstName":"Clint","middleName":"","lastName":"Sidle"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 131","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH131","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Graduate and UG Srs Only\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Non-Johnson Students ONLY:  January 19th at 8:00am to February 10th at 4:00pm.

This course aims to prepare students to work effectively and professionally, in and with family firms, to launch and create cross-generational value and wealth in family firms.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":350349,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5870","titleShort":"International Mergers & Acq","titleLong":"International Mergers and Acquisitions","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12892,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:00PM","timeEnd":"06:10PM","startDt":"02/05/2016","endDt":"02/05/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"jjh22","firstName":"James","middleName":"Judge","lastName":"Hanks"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"07:00PM","timeEnd":"09:30PM","startDt":"02/05/2016","endDt":"02/05/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"jjh22","firstName":"James","middleName":"Judge","lastName":"Hanks"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":3,"timeStart":"01:30PM","timeEnd":"02:30PM","startDt":"02/12/2016","endDt":"02/12/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"jjh22","firstName":"James","middleName":"Judge","lastName":"Hanks"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":4,"timeStart":"05:00PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"02/26/2016","endDt":"02/26/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"jjh22","firstName":"James","middleName":"Judge","lastName":"Hanks"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B09","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB09","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":5,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"11:30AM","startDt":"02/27/2016","endDt":"02/27/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"jjh22","firstName":"James","middleName":"Judge","lastName":"Hanks"}],"pattern":"S","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":6,"timeStart":"01:30PM","timeEnd":"06:30PM","startDt":"03/18/2016","endDt":"03/18/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"jjh22","firstName":"James","middleName":"Judge","lastName":"Hanks"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Add/Drop dates:   Johnson Students - January 19th at 8:00am thru February 10th or prior to first class if class is held before these dates.

The graded work is a written proposal for an M&amp;A transaction between two existing companies in different countries prepared by small teams. Proposals are based on publicly available financial, business, legal, and other documents and data and any other information obtained. The goal of the written work is to simulate the process in which business people, investment bankers, and lawyers work together to structure transactions across national borders. The reading covers the basic business and legal issues most frequently encountered in international mergers and acquisitions.

Sessions will examine the constraints to entrepreneurs and the ways in which they obtain financing with a particular focus on venture capital and emerging markets. The course will use cases of successful entrepreneurs under the most difficult circumstances and will address entrepreneurship in a serious downturn and networking across borders. In addition to common issues related to starting a business and investing in it, the class will address issues not normally on the radar screen of U.S. entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. The course will draw on the experience of investors and entrepreneurs, cases prepared especially for this course, as well as findings reported in the research literature. This course is meant to be in part a practical guide to students who wish to be entrepreneurs outside the United States or to create cross-border businesses. It may be of interest to people working in entrepreneurial environments in other organizations or students who want to get involved in various forms of financing entrepreneurial ventures. Students may use the course to explore development of a business concept or plan outside (at least in part) the United States. There will be a particular concentration on Asia, the role of government in stimulating entrepreneurship and venture capital and the nitty-gritty issues of valuing young and private firms sharing profits, raising resources, and organizing and managing human resources.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: At least one finance or economics class.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":367961,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5940","titleShort":"Mergers & Acquisitions","titleLong":"Mergers and Acquisitions - Accounting, Modeling and Evaluation of Deals","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18635,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:00PM","timeEnd":"05:30PM","startDt":"03/11/2016","endDt":"03/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":10,"netid":"rbr77","firstName":"Radha","middleName":"Balkrishna","lastName":"Radhakrishna"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B05","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB05","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"12:30PM","startDt":"03/12/2016","endDt":"03/12/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"S","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B05","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB05","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Add/Drop dates:   Johnson Students - January 19th at 8:00am thru February 10th or prior to first class if class is held before these dates.

Electronic commerce involves a wide variety of cooperating technologies (e.g., communications, networks, databases, expert systems, and multimedia) and affects a wide variety of managerial issues. It created a new emphasis on information technologies and systems in management; led to the development of new technologies and new combinations of existing technologies to support management; and occasionally radically altered business practices and the role of management. Students in this course learn to conduct economic transactions and manage businesses on the Internet. All major technical and managerial issues are covered through computer exercises on the Internet and case studies and examples of businesses on the Internet.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":350432,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6030","titleShort":"Strategies for Sustainability","titleLong":"Strategies for Sustainability","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":14859,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"03/18/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"gwd39","firstName":"Glen","middleName":"W.S.","lastName":"Dowell"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"GM and Grad Students Only\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 19th at 8:00am to February 10th at Noon.  \nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 19th at 8:00am to February 10th at Noon.  \nNon-Johnson Students:  February 4th at 8:00am to February 10th at 4:00pm.  \nYou may add or drop a first-half class after February 10th with permission of the faculty.

In particular, we study the fundamentals of commodity futures returns and momentum strategy on commodity investment, the carry trade and momentum strategy on currency investment, the volatility strategy on option investment. In addition to delivering trading strategies, we pay close attention to common risk factors behind these investment strategies. Special topics change from one year to another to reflect recent trends and practices in industry, and also the state-of-art research in academia. This year's special topics are stock crash concerns and expected returns, rare disaster concerns and hedge fund performance, and global tail risks across different asset classes.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":350631,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6470","titleShort":"Advanced Spreadsheet Modeling","titleLong":"Advanced Spreadsheet Modeling","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17359,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"03/18/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lwr2","firstName":"Lawrence","middleName":"W.","lastName":"Robinson"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 257-Parker","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH257","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Pre-Req:  NBA 6430\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 19th at 8:00am to February 10th at Noon.  \nNon-Johnson Students:  February 4th at 8:00am to February 10th at 4:00pm.  \nYou may add or drop a first-half class after February 10th with permission of the faculty.

Three methods of valuation are introduced: intrinsic valuation, relative valuation by multiples using comparables, and contingent claims valuation, based on a real options approach. The rest of the course will be dedicated to understanding each of these methods in greater detail and more importantly, applying them to the valuation of actual companies. This will involve understanding in detail discounted cash-flow models and the many inputs required to build them; dividend discount models; the determination and use of relative-value multiples such as price/earnings and price/book value; and finally, how to apply option theory to specific problems in valuation. The course includes a special session on valuation approaches and challenges specific to venture capital and private-equity investing. This will include a discussion of topics such as required internal rates of return (IRRs), the effects of leverage on valuation, and issues relating to the valuation of high-growth startups.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":364724,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6620","titleShort":"Product Marketing Insights","titleLong":"Product Marketing Insights","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12962,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"03/14/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mkt27","firstName":"Manoj","middleName":"","lastName":"Thomas"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B09","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB09","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"03/21/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mkt27","firstName":"Manoj","middleName":"","lastName":"Thomas"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B05","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB05","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Add/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 19th at 8:00am to February 10th at 4:00pm.  \nNon-Johnson Students:  February 4th at 8:00am to February 10th at 4:00pm.  \nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 10th with permission of the faculty.

In the past, some students from the Engineering, Hotel, AEM (Dyson) and ILR programs have also attended this course. Impactful business leaders appreciate the importance of consumer insights. Many strategic decisions - such as introducing a new product, repositioning an existing product, or deciding whether to extend an existing brand or to introduce a new brand - are pivoted on consumer insights. In this course I will discuss how managers can uncover behavioral insights and use those insights to shape product marketing strategy. The course will cover the following four topics: CONSUMER INSIGHTS (What is consumer insight? What research methods can be used to uncover consumer insights?), POSITIONING &amp; BRANDING (Can you do the financial analysis required for a marketing plan? Why is positioning so important? Which segment should you target? Can intangible brand associations influence market shares? Should you extend your brand?Â  How is brand value measured?), INNOVATION (Do you have to be a pioneer to successfully innovate? How can new product diffusion be modeled? Is your category lifecycle slow-and-long or fast-and-short? How to test a concept? How can you optimize the attributes of your new concept? How can you forecast the sales of the new product?), PRICING &amp; ADVERTISING (Will a higher price help or hurt your brand? Does share-of-voice predict market share?). Please note that there is a significant overlap between the material taught in this course and the Strategic Brand Management course (NBA 6240) taught by me in the Strategic Marketing Immersion program. Therefore students, who have already attended the Strategic Marketing Immersion course will not be allowed to enroll for this course.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":350671,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6650","titleShort":"Strat Mgmt of Tech & Innov","titleLong":"The Strategic Management of Technology and Innovation","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12863,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"05:40PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":11,"netid":"rll36","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"Louis","lastName":"Laperle"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Open to GM and Grad Students Only \nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 19th at 8:00am to February 10th at 4:00pm.  \nNon-Johnson Students:  February 4th at 8:00am to February 10th at 4:00pm.  \nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 10th with permission of the faculty.

This course is designed for students who may someday work in, consult for, and/or create firms whose primary product is fundamentally related to technology or innovation. The course typically includes both M.B.A. students and graduate students in science. It starts by examining how industries are transformed by new technologies and how these patterns of industrial change generate both opportunity and high rates of firm failure. We will then explore the questions: Why do some technology leaders fail? and How do technology innovators successfully take on and replace incumbent firms? This leads to an examination of internal management issues, focusing on the design of innovative organizations: designing reward systems, managing growth, overcoming resistance to change, and using organizational culture to promote innovation.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":350684,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6680","titleShort":"Advanced Oral Communications","titleLong":"Advanced Oral Communications","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17982,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"03/21/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":12,"netid":"bem5","firstName":"Barbara","middleName":"E.","lastName":"Mink"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"anj1","firstName":"Angela","middleName":"","lastName":"Noble-Grange"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 131","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH131","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Pre-req:  NBA 5680 or NBA 5660\r\n***MUST ATTEND FIRST CLASS***.\r\nNon-Johnson students must see their college registrar regarding policies connected with adding/dropping a second half Johnson School class.

In general, an organization cannot survive without the trust of numerous stakeholders, and ethical lapses destroy trust and threaten vital stakeholder relationships.

It begins by examining normative concepts and principles that typically enter into moral reasoning, then uses those concepts and principles to analyze cases.

Topics include strategic cooperation and punishment between firms, strategic commitments, predatory and limit pricing, entry deterrence, and auctions. The final deliverable is a take-home essay in which you apply the course material to a game theoretic setting of your choice.

The course includes two parts. In the first part, students develop a set of core skills essential to financial statement analysis. We cover strategic ratio analysis, cash flow analysis, forecasting, proforma financial statements, and firm valuation using discounted cash flow and residual income techniques. The second part focuses on more advanced financial statement topics and specialized industries. We cover investment research, accounting analysis, credit analysis, banking, mergers and acquisitions, and issues relating to international financial statement analysis. The course emphasizes the practical application of the material using a combination of lecture, cases, and hands-on examples.Â  Students are evaluated based on a project and two exams.Â  The course presumes an understanding of basic corporate finance theory and basic financial accounting, but little or no previous experience in security valuation. The class is designed for students planning for careers in investment banking, corporate management, venture capital, security analysis, credit analysis, consulting, or public accounting.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: Non-Johnson School students only.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":350049,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5070","titleShort":"Entrep For Scientist & Engrs","titleLong":"Entrepreneurship for Scientists and Engineers","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13233,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":19,"netid":"ssg22","firstName":"Steven","middleName":"Samuel","lastName":"Gal"},{"instrAssignSeq":16,"netid":"jln17","firstName":"John","middleName":"L.","lastName":"Nesheim"},{"instrAssignSeq":17,"netid":"ksr77","firstName":"Kenneth","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Rother"},{"instrAssignSeq":18,"netid":"tps1","firstName":"Tom","middleName":"","lastName":"Schryver"},{"instrAssignSeq":15,"netid":"bnt5","firstName":"Bradley","middleName":"Nikalaus","lastName":"Treat"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***Open to Non-Johnson Grad and UG Srs Only***\nNon-Johnson Students ONLY:  August 16th at 8:00am to September 6th at 4:00pm.

Externally, leaders must manage not only supply chain and customer relationships, but also seek to fundamentally change the social, environmental and legal environments in which business operates. A major focus of the course will be on the challenges associated with connecting social initiatives and missions with bottomâline benefits. These include: How can the goals of a company be articulated in and driven by the corporate mission? How can leaders establish a mission that is big enough to attract employees, customers and partners but specific enough to be achievable? What does success look like for a social entrepreneur?

Do you want to learn how to write a long research paper? Do you not want to take a final examination? If so this course may be for you. Since the beginning of the republic, American intellectuals, politicians and businessmen have extolled the exceptionalism of America. In a world of diverse forms of capitalism, can this view be sustained? Is America a shining city on the hill or a darkened city in the valley? Comparison is an effective way to discern and assess what is unique and what is general in the distinctive form of America's capitalist democracy. In this course the liberal market economy of the United States with its distinctive strengths and weaknesses is put side-by-side with different forms of liberal, corporatist and statist market economies that characterize different European countries in the emerging European polity. The diversity of capitalism points to one overarching conclusion: all of these countries are arguably capitalist, democratic market economies belonging to \"the West;\" and each of them has distinctive strengths and weaknesses. Like all other countries, America is ordinary in mobilizing its formidable capacities and displaying its glaring weaknesses as it copes with change.Â ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":350179,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5350","titleShort":"Fed Income Tax- Corp and Share","titleLong":"Federal Income Taxation of Corporations and Shareholders","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17518,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"10/07/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jwm336","firstName":"John","middleName":"W.","lastName":"McKinley"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Warren Hall B02","bldgDescr":"Warren Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WRNB02","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Co-meets with AEM 4560."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"10/07/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"7W1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"10/07/2016","sessionLong":"Seven Week - First"}],"description":"This course presents the tax skills necessary to make business decisions pertaining to corporations and their shareholders.Â  Emphasis is placed on such areas as a corporation's formation and capital structure, earnings and profits, dividend distributions, redemptions, liquidations and reorganizations of corporations.Â  Practical application of the tax law will be emphasized with proper consideration placed on the historical, economic and political perspectives of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":368230,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5355","titleShort":"Fed income Tax- Ent, Est, Trst","titleLong":"Federal Income Taxation of Flow Through Entities, Estates and Trusts","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17517,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jwm336","firstName":"John","middleName":"W.","lastName":"McKinley"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Warren Hall B02","bldgDescr":"Warren Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WRNB02","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Co-meets with AEM 4560.\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students August 16th thru September 6th with an additional Add/Drop period beginning October 12th at 8:00am to October 18th at 4:00pm. \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  October 15th at 8:00am to October 18th 4:00pm.

This course focuses on these issues and highlights how finance theory can be extended to address them. Students apply the basic principles of international finance to a variety of problems. The course helps students understand the ideas and research results of international finance and adapt what they learn to the practical problems in the increasingly globalized business world. The first part of the course outlines exchange rate volatility, barriers to international capital flows, and the value of international diversification. The second part presents a variety of problems, examples, and applications from the three basic themes described in part one.

Over the spring and summer largely fortune 500 companies are solicited for projects that students can work on during the fall semester, with three to five days during the semester of on-site interaction with client companies at their location or on campus. The projects are done by teams of students, typically four to five, supported by both the faculty and an experienced adviser. Lecture material covers the approach to structuring complex problems, conducting analytical work and developing conclusions and recommendations. Student teams are expected to communicate regularly with their clients and to have at least one interim and final presentations. These experiential-learning projects will integrate the concepts and knowledge covered in the core courses and immersions as well as other fall electives. These client-critical projects typically incorporate the broad areas of strategy, operations, finance or marketing. Grading is a blend of client and faculty assessments.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: M.B.A. students only.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":350318,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5780","titleShort":"Problem-Solving Projec Proc","titleLong":"Problem-Solving Project Process","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15468,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"nhp7","firstName":"Nate","middleName":"","lastName":"Peck"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"** JOHNSON AND GRAD STUDENTS ONLY **\r\nUG Students must receive permission from instructor.\r\n** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\r\nDeadline to Change Grading Option:  November 7th @4:00pm\r\nAdd/Drop permitted for ONE WEEK ONLY after class begins!   \r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students August 16th thru September 6th with an additional Add/Drop period beginning October 12th at 8:00am to October 18th at 4:00pm. \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  October 15th at 8:00am to October 18th 4:00pm.

What special challenges face women as they transition from students to managers to leaders? What do the latest research findings offer to women who are seeking C-level positions and the organizations that want to benefit from more women leaders? In this course, we will take a multi-pronged approach to learning about women and leadership to better prepare students of both genders to lead in organizations that are now comprised of nearly 50% women. To do this we will analyze case studies of women leaders pulled from a range of industries. We will review the current state of empirical evidence about the status of women as leaders, investigate the barriers that have made it more difficult for women to reach the top of the business world, and consider ways in which individuals and organizations can overcome them. Guest speakers will share their experiences with the class. Finally, there will be time to engage in deep reflection about what students expect from their careers, as well as a chance to consider the pathways they must take to become effective and inclusive leaders in increasingly diverse organizations.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":359203,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6150","titleShort":"Bus Chin in Cultural Context I","titleLong":"Business Chinese in Cultural Context I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16275,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"zc46","firstName":"Zhihong","middleName":"","lastName":"Chen"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"McGraw Hall 365","bldgDescr":"McGraw Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MCG365","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Prerequisite: two years (on heritage track) or three years of Chinese or equivalent.

The course focuses on three themes: (1) the source, discovery, and evaluation of technological opportunities on a university campus; (2) increasing the efficiency of the innovation process to produce new technologies that satisfy customer needs; and (3) the different mechanisms available to appropriate returns from technology. The course uses readings, cases, and discussions with practitioners to examine this phenomenon. After completing this class, students will be familiar with basic principles related to technology entrepreneurship and will have gained a deeper understanding of the technology commercialization process at Cornell.

In general, an organization cannot survive without the trust of numerous stakeholders, and ethical lapses destroy trust and threaten vital stakeholder relationships. In today's volatile and fiercely competitive business environment, a manager must be able to identify and effectively resolve ethical issues that inevitably arise in the pursuit of business (and career) objectives. This course is designed to enhance students' skills in moral reasoning as it applies to managerial decision making. It begins by examining normative concepts and principles that typically enter into moral reasoning, then uses those concepts and principles to analyze cases. Discussions are designed to help students understand the moral issues confronting the decision makers in the cases and explore how those issues might be addressed in ethically responsible ways.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":350704,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6730","titleShort":"Derivatives Securities Part I","titleLong":"Derivatives Securities Part I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15448,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"10/07/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":13,"netid":"dh634","firstName":"Darien","middleName":"","lastName":"Huang"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"05:40PM","startDt":"09/26/2016","endDt":"09/26/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":13,"netid":"dh634","firstName":"Darien","middleName":"","lastName":"Huang"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***GM, GR and UG Srs Only***\n** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\nDeadline to Change Grading Option:  September 20th 4:00pm\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students â August 16th at 8:00am to September 6th at 4:00pm.

Even purely domestic firms have to deal with international issues, be it in the form of imported supplies or foreign competitors. In addition, more and more companies are going abroad to pursue their major business objectives. How can they take advantage of the global marketplace and create economic value through their multimarket activities? This course has three integrated objectives: first, to give you a basic grounding in global business, so that you can become capable of understanding and analyzing events and trends in the global business environment and their impact on managerial decision making; second, to help you understand the analytical frameworks on strategy formulation and implementation in an international context; and third, through a series of concrete case discussions and a local product internationalization project, the course aims at developing your practical skills in applying the tools of global strategic analysis in concrete business situations. Its ultimate goal is to help you become better prepared to serve in and lead business organizations in today's globalized world.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Winter.","catalogComments":"Johnson School students will not receive credit for winter session courses offered through Continuing Education.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"WI17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":350014,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"3000","titleShort":"Entrepreneur & Private Equity","titleLong":"Entrepreneur and Private Equity","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16357,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ssg22","firstName":"Steven","middleName":"Samuel","lastName":"Gal"},{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"ksr77","firstName":"Kenneth","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Rother"},{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"tps1","firstName":"Tom","middleName":"","lastName":"Schryver"},{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"bnt5","firstName":"Bradley","middleName":"Nikalaus","lastName":"Treat"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B09","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB09","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"*Undergrad Seniors and Juniors ONLY*\r\nAdd/Drop Dates: Non-Johnson Students âJanuary 17th â February 8th.\r\nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 8th only with permission of the faculty.

Taxes have a direct impact on cash flow and often divert 30 to 40 percent of the firm's pretax cash flow to the government, effectively making the government the single largest stakeholder in many firms. Having an understanding of taxation and how firms plan accordingly is important for just about any career path students choose, whether they will be an investment banker, venture capitalist, consultant, money manager, CFO, treasurer, controller, taking over a family-owned business, or an entrepreneur setting up a new business. Topics include tax planning fundamentals, corporate tax fundamentals, taxation of mergers and acquisitions, taxation of divestitures, international taxation, taxes and wealth planning.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: NCC 5000, NCC 5060.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":350031,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5020","titleShort":"Managerial Acctng & Reporting","titleLong":"Managerial Accounting and Reporting","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13175,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":14,"netid":"rdg222","firstName":"Ryan","middleName":"","lastName":"Guggenmos"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B06","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB06","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"*Open to GM, Grad, UG Srs and Jrs.*\nAdd/Drop Dates: \tJohnson Students â January 17th â February 8th.\nNon-Johnson Students â February 2nd â February 8th \nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 8th only with permission of the faculty.

The attitudes, values, and practices that prevail in their organizations induce otherwise ethical employees to take actions that violate widely shared norms of conduct. Such behavior can be costly-even disastrous-leading to ruined careers, tarnished corporate reputations, and legal liability for the individuals and their companies. In an environment where \"only results matter,\" it can be difficult for a new MBA or law school graduate to recognize the risks. If she does see the dangers, she may still find it hard to avoid them.Â  This course seeks to help MBAs and law students understand how a firm's culture, combined with common human tendencies, can tempt-or push-employees into unethical behavior. It also considers how employees can meet ethical challenges posed by their firms' cultures. Class sessions include discussion of case studies and readings reporting on relevant research in psychology and organizational behavior, as well as talks by noted guest speakers from the worlds of business, law, journalism, and academia. The grade in the course is based on class participation and on two written case analyses, including a final project.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":361612,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5150","titleShort":"Leadership Theory & Practice","titleLong":"Leadership Theory and Practice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13177,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"12:00PM","startDt":"01/17/2017","endDt":"01/21/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mjh35","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Hostetler"}],"pattern":"TWRFS","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"04:30PM","startDt":"01/17/2017","endDt":"01/21/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"TWRFS","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***NON-JOHNSON GRAD and UG SENIORS ONLY***\n\n** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\nDeadline for Changing Grade Option: January 17th by 4:00pm\nYou may add or drop an arranged class after the FIRST CLASS ONLY with permission of the faculty.

It will examine various new developments in retailing and the application of operations management principles to these developments. It is recommended for students interested in careers in (1) Retailing and supply chain management, (2) Businesses like banking, consulting, and information technology that provide services to retailers, and (3) Manufacturing companies that sell their products through retailers. Retailing is not only a link in the supply chain, but also an important industry for a number of reasons. This industry, more than any other, is at the forefront of business changes since it directly connects with the consumer and generates demand for the rest of the economy. It is an intensely dynamic industry, with continuous changes in marketing channels, technology, and sourcing. It has gone through remarkable developments through history, and has often been an incubator for new business concepts. Currently, retailing is leading economic growth and transformation in emerging markets around the world, both through global sourcing and global marketing. In the US, retailing comprises 40% of the economy, and is the largest employer. Problems faced by retailers are shared by other firms in the economy, and retailers are often the dominant player in a supply chain. Thus, retailing is also academically interesting as a laboratory to learn and test concepts that may apply to other businesses. Various types of sophisticated data can be collected in retailing easier than in other industries. Performance can be measured accurately and rapidly. Managers in retailing can also change their strategies and product mix in relatively short periods of time. Finally, low entry and exit barriers magnify risks and rewards in this industry, so that we find firms with stellar growth as well those with a history of bankruptcies. We shall study all these different aspects of retail operations through case discussions and lectures.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368509,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5245","titleShort":"Introduction to Macroeconomics","titleLong":"Introduction to Macroeconomics","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17852,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sk2922","firstName":"Sofia","middleName":"","lastName":"Kalantzi"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Add/Drop Dates: \tJohnson Students â January 17th â February 8th.\r\nNon-Johnson Students â February 2nd â February 8th \r\nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 8th only with permission of the faculty.

At the beginning of the simulation, each team develops a strategy, and before the results of the last decision have been determined, presents an analysis of its performance, lessons learned, and its strategy for the future in a final presentation. The first course meeting is 2 hours to introduce the simulation and its mechanics as well as a discussion of company strategy. Future meetings are weekly for 2 hours which includes time for teams to review their performance and work on their company decisions. Grades are based on the value created for the company's shareholders (relative to other firms in the same industry), the team's strategy, and the instructor's evaluation of team's performance at the final presentation.

Firms in creative industries, play a role in every aspect of our lives, and influence many physical and psychological aspects of our lives, from what we eat and wear to how we entertain ourselves, but markets for cultural goods are complex and difficult to navigate. Entrepreneurs must, therefore, understand the economic sociology of the cultural market and ecosystem in order to capture economic value, a process that recursively relates to cultural norms. At the same time, the creative industries are seen by some as the last frontier for technological innovations, where many of the gains made in other sectors by pioneering entrepreneurial leaders, have not yet been realized. This course will examine why this is the case by shedding light on the underlying economic, social, and cultural rules and norms that govern the structure and functioning of these markets, in order to derive strategies and business models for entrepreneurial success. These firms thus capture economic value by transforming cultural norms in ways that appear to, and sometimes do, change the way we think and live. This course will analyze business cases of such market-pioneers in a wide range of creative industries such as art, fashion, film, food, music, publishing, and theater to explore and understand the economic, organizational, and sociological underpinnings of entrepreneurship, value(s), markets, and culture. The course is targeted towards students who wish to understand the structure of creative industries and be inspired to start, work or consult for, or invest in large and small creative, high-impact firms. The course may also interest students seeking to understand how firms offering radical innovations can create new markets by addressing the entire market ecosystem.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":350321,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5790","titleShort":"Cases in Business Strategy","titleLong":"Cases in Business Strategy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16656,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"03/20/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"hs39","firstName":"Hernan","middleName":"J.F.","lastName":"Saenz"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jhs20","firstName":"Jan","middleName":"H.","lastName":"Suwinski"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B05","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB05","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"*Johnson Students Only*\nAdd/Drop Dates: \tJohnson Students â March 20th â March 27th \nNon-Johnson Students â March 24th â March 27th \nYou may add or drop a second-half class after March 27th only with permission of the faculty.

Electronic commerce involves a wide variety of cooperating technologies (e.g., communications, networks, databases, expert systems, and multimedia) and affects a wide variety of managerial issues. It created a new emphasis on information technologies and systems in management; led to the development of new technologies and new combinations of existing technologies to support management; and occasionally radically altered business practices and the role of management.

What special challenges face women as they transition from students to managers to leaders? What do the latest research findings offer to women who are seeking C-level positions and the organizations that want to benefit from more women leaders? In this course, we will take a multi-pronged approach to learning about women and leadership to better prepare students of both genders to lead in organizations that are now comprised of nearly 50% women. To do this we will analyze case studies of women leaders pulled from a range of industries. We will review the current state of empirical evidence about the status of women as leaders, investigate the barriers that have made it more difficult for women to reach the top of the business world, and consider ways in which individuals and organizations can overcome them. Guest speakers will share their experiences with the class. Finally, there will be time to engage in deep reflection about what students expect from their careers, as well as a chance to consider the pathways they must take to become effective and inclusive leaders in increasingly diverse organizations.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":364726,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6180","titleShort":"Global Innovation & Technology","titleLong":"Global Innovation and Technology Commercialization","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15439,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"06:00PM","startDt":"03/03/2017","endDt":"03/03/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":9,"netid":"wds4","firstName":"Wesley","middleName":"","lastName":"Sine"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B06","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB06","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"05:00PM","startDt":"03/04/2017","endDt":"03/04/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"S","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B06","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB06","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":3,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"06:00PM","startDt":"03/17/2017","endDt":"03/24/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":4,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"05:00PM","startDt":"03/25/2017","endDt":"03/25/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"S","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Open to ALL Students\nStudents can drop after the FIRST CLASS ONLY - by sending an email to the Johnson School Registrar's Office at gm-registrar@cornell.edu.

Three methods of valuation are introduced: intrinsic valuation, relative valuation by multiples using comparables, and contingent claims valuation, based on a real options approach. The rest of the course will be dedicated to understanding each of these methods in greater detail and more importantly, applying them to the valuation of actual companies. This will involve understanding in detail discounted cash-flow models and the many inputs required to build them; dividend discount models; the determination and use of relative-value multiples such as price/earnings and price/book value; and finally, how to apply option theory to specific problems in valuation. The course includes a special session on valuation approaches and challenges specific to venture capital and private-equity investing. This will include a discussion of topics such as required internal rates of return (IRRs), the effects of leverage on valuation, and issues relating to the valuation of high-growth startups.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":364724,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6620","titleShort":"Product Marketing Insights","titleLong":"Product Marketing Insights","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13284,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mkt27","firstName":"Manoj","middleName":"","lastName":"Thomas"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"*Open to GM, Grad and UG Srs.*\nNon-Johnson students may add themselves to the waitlists during the enrollment periods, however Johnson Students have priority into the classes and non-Johnsons will be enrolled: 1) IF seats are still available after Johnson students complete their enrollment period and 2) IF the instructor allows.\n\nAdd/Drop Dates: \tJohnson Students â January 17th â February 8th.\nNon-Johnson Students â February 2nd â February 8th \nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 8th only with permission of the faculty.

In the past, some students from the Engineering, Hotel, AEM (Dyson) and ILR programs have also attended this course. Impactful business leaders appreciate the importance of consumer insights. Many strategic decisions - such as introducing a new product, repositioning an existing product, or deciding whether to extend an existing brand or to introduce a new brand - are pivoted on consumer insights. In this course I will discuss how managers can uncover behavioral insights and use those insights to shape product marketing strategy. The course will cover the following four topics: CONSUMER INSIGHTS (What is consumer insight? What research methods can be used to uncover consumer insights?), POSITIONING &amp; BRANDING (Can you do the financial analysis required for a marketing plan? Why is positioning so important? Which segment should you target? Can intangible brand associations influence market shares? Should you extend your brand?Â  How is brand value measured?), INNOVATION (Do you have to be a pioneer to successfully innovate? How can new product diffusion be modeled? Is your category lifecycle slow-and-long or fast-and-short? How to test a concept? How can you optimize the attributes of your new concept? How can you forecast the sales of the new product?), PRICING &amp; ADVERTISING (Will a higher price help or hurt your brand? Does share-of-voice predict market share?). Please note that there is a significant overlap between the material taught in this course and the Strategic Brand Management course (NBA 6240) taught by me in the Strategic Marketing Immersion program. Therefore students, who have already attended the Strategic Marketing Immersion course will not be allowed to enroll for this course.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":350671,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6650","titleShort":"Strat Mgmt of Tech & Innov","titleLong":"The Strategic Management of Technology and Innovation","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13192,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"05:40PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":11,"netid":"rll36","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"Louis","lastName":"Laperle"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Open to GM and Grad Students Only \r\n\r\nNon-Johnson students may add themselves to the waitlists during the enrollment periods, however Johnson Students have priority into the classes and non-Johnsons will be enrolled: 1) IF seats are still available after Johnson students complete their enrollment period and 2) IF the instructor allows.\r\n\r\nAdd/Drop Dates: \tJohnson Students â January 17th â February 8th.\r\nNon-Johnson Students â February 2nd â February 8th \r\nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 8th only with permission of the faculty.

This course is designed for students who may someday work in, consult for, and/or create firms whose primary product is fundamentally related to technology or innovation. The course typically includes both M.B.A. students and graduate students in science. It starts by examining how industries are transformed by new technologies and how these patterns of industrial change generate both opportunity and high rates of firm failure. We will then explore the questions: Why do some technology leaders fail? and How do technology innovators successfully take on and replace incumbent firms? This leads to an examination of internal management issues, focusing on the design of innovative organizations: designing reward systems, managing growth, overcoming resistance to change, and using organizational culture to promote innovation.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368109,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6682","titleShort":"Crisis Comm. for Business Ldrs","titleLong":"Crisis Communications for Business Leaders","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16645,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"03/17/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"tk626","firstName":"Theomary","middleName":"","lastName":"Karamanis"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 134","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH134","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"** MUST ATTEND FIRST CLASS **\nAdd/Drop Dates: \tJohnson Students â January 17th â February 8th  \nNon-Johnson Students â February 2nd - February 8th\nYou may add or drop a first-half class after February 8th only with permission of the faculty.

In general, an organization cannot survive without the trust of numerous stakeholders, and ethical lapses destroy trust and threaten vital stakeholder relationships. In today's volatile and fiercely competitive business environment, a manager must be able to identify and effectively resolve ethical issues that inevitably arise in the pursuit of business (and career) objectives. This course is designed to enhance students' skills in moral reasoning as it applies to managerial decision making. It begins by examining normative concepts and principles that typically enter into moral reasoning, then uses those concepts and principles to analyze cases. Discussions are designed to help students understand the moral issues confronting the decision makers in the cases and explore how those issues might be addressed in ethically responsible ways.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":350723,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6780","titleShort":"Advanced Private Equity","titleLong":"Advanced Private Equity: Negotiations and Structuring","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13215,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"04/03/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"slg63","firstName":"Steven","middleName":"L.","lastName":"Greenberg"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 141","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH141","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:25PM","startDt":"04/17/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"slg63","firstName":"Steven","middleName":"L.","lastName":"Greenberg"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 141","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH141","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"GM and Grad students Only\nPrerequisites: NBA 5640, NBA 3000, or permission of instructor. \n\nNon-Johnson students may add themselves to the waitlists during the enrollment periods, however Johnson Students have priority into the classes and non-Johnsons will be enrolled: 1) IF seats are still available after Johnson students complete their enrollment period and 2) IF the instructor allows.\n\nAdd/Drop Dates: \tJohnson Students â January 17th â February 8th.\nNon-Johnson Students â February 2nd â February 8th \nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 8th only with permission of the faculty.

Even purely domestic firms have to deal with international issues, be it in the form of imported supplies or foreign competitors. In addition, more and more companies are going abroad to pursue their major business objectives. How can they take advantage of the global marketplace and create economic value through their multimarket activities? This course has three integrated objectives: first, to give you a basic grounding in global business, so that you can become capable of understanding and analyzing events and trends in the global business environment and their impact on managerial decision making; second, to help you understand the analytical frameworks on strategy formulation and implementation in an international context; and third, through a series of concrete case discussions and a local product internationalization project, the course aims at developing your practical skills in applying the tools of global strategic analysis in concrete business situations. Its ultimate goal is to help you become better prepared to serve in and lead business organizations in today's globalized world.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Winter.","catalogComments":"Johnson School students will not receive credit for winter session courses offered through Continuing Education.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU","roster":"SU17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":350014,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"3000","titleShort":"Entrepreneur & Private Equity","titleLong":"Entrepreneur and Private Equity","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13341,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":13,"netid":"djb16","firstName":"David","middleName":"J.","lastName":"BenDaniel"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"**UG Seniors and Juniors only**\nNon-Johnson Students ONLY:  August 15th at 8:00am thru September 5th at 4:00pm.

We cover strategic ratio analysis, cash flow analysis, forecasting, proforma financial statements, and firm valuation using discounted cash flow and residual income techniques. The second part focuses on more advanced financial statement topics and specialized industries. We cover investment research, accounting analysis, credit analysis, banking, mergers and acquisitions, and issues relating to international financial statement analysis. The course emphasizes the practical application of the material using a combination of lecture, cases, and hands-on examples.Â  Students are evaluated based on a project and two exams.Â  The course presumes an understanding of basic corporate finance theory and basic financial accounting, but little or no previous experience in security valuation.

The course attempts to provide a general working knowledge of the financial system by examining not only how various intermediaries and markets work, but also their evolution over time.Â  The role of central banks, and their operations, is particularly emphasized, as is the nature of risk management both within the financial institution and more broadly for the financial system. Topics considered here include swaps, credit derivatives, value at risk models, and systemic risk. Just as intermediation has moved from institutions to markets, the course follows a similar evolution in the topics studied over the course of the semester. Market topics examined include securitization, the money markets, the Treasury market, and the financial crisis.Â Ethical issues in the financial markets are also examined.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: NCC 5060.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":350242,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5540","titleShort":"International Finance","titleLong":"International Finance","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13342,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"wbb1","firstName":"Warren","middleName":"B.","lastName":"Bailey"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"**Open to Johnson and Graduate Students Only\nPre-req: NCC 5060 or NCC 5560\nNO DROPS WILL BE ALLOWED AFTER THE LAST DAY OF ADD/DROP Instructor will NOT sign any late add/drop forms.\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students â August 15th at 8:00am thru September 5th at 4:00pm.

International finance is different in two basic respects: (1) the existence of multiple currencies adds risk to investment and financing decisions; (2) when corporations and portfolio investors cross international borders, both problems and opportunities arise. This course focuses on these issues and highlights how finance theory can be extended to address them. Students apply the basic principles of international finance to a variety of problems. The course helps students understand the ideas and research results of international finance and adapt what they learn to the practical problems in the increasingly globalized business world. The first part of the course outlines exchange rate volatility, barriers to international capital flows, and the value of international diversification. The second part presents a variety of problems, examples, and applications from the three basic themes described in part one. Spreadsheet assignments and a term project requiring data analysis develop research skills and illustrate academic concepts. Exams consist of computational, short answer, and short essay questions.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Graduate students only.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: NCC 5060Â or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":350245,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5550","titleShort":"Fixed Inc &Int Rate Der","titleLong":"Fixed Income Securities and Interest Rate Options","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13257,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"raj15","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Jarrow"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***Johnson and Graduate Students Only ***\nLetter or S/U.

Over the spring and summer largely fortune 500 companies are solicited for projects that students can work on during the fall semester, with three to five days during the semester of on-site interaction with client companies at their location or on campus. The projects are done by teams of students, typically four to five, supported by both the faculty and an experienced adviser. Lecture material covers the approach to structuring complex problems, conducting analytical work and developing conclusions and recommendations. Student teams are expected to communicate regularly with their clients and to have at least one interim and final presentations. These experiential-learning projects will integrate the concepts and knowledge covered in the core courses and immersions as well as other fall electives. These client-critical projects typically incorporate the broad areas of strategy, operations, finance or marketing. Grading is a blend of client and faculty assessments.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: M.B.A. students only.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":368533,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5795","titleShort":"Advanced Strategic Analysis","titleLong":"Advanced Strategic Analysis","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15741,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"10/06/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"pmb234","firstName":"Peter","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Balnaves"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"*Open to Johnson Students Only*\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students â August 15th at 8:00am thru September 5th at 4:00pm.

What special challenges face women as they transition from students to managers to leaders? What do the latest research findings offer to women who are seeking C-level positions and the organizations that want to benefit from more women leaders? In this course, we will take a multi-pronged approach to learning about women and leadership to better prepare students of both genders to lead in organizations that are now comprised of nearly 50% women. To do this we will analyze case studies of women leaders pulled from a range of industries. We will review the current state of empirical evidence about the status of women as leaders, investigate the barriers that have made it more difficult for women to reach the top of the business world, and consider ways in which individuals and organizations can overcome them. Guest speakers will share their experiences with the class. Finally, there will be time to engage in deep reflection about what students expect from their careers, as well as a chance to consider the pathways they must take to become effective and inclusive leaders in increasingly diverse organizations.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":359203,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6150","titleShort":"Bus Chin in Cultural Context I","titleLong":"Business Chinese in Cultural Context I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":13410,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"zc46","firstName":"Zhihong","middleName":"","lastName":"Chen"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Prerequisite: two years (on heritage track) or three years of Chinese or equivalent.

Three methods of valuation are introduced: intrinsic valuation, relative valuation by multiples using comparables, and contingent claims valuation, based on a real options approach. The rest of the course will be dedicated to understanding each of these methods in greater detail and more importantly, applying them to the valuation of actual companies. This will involve understanding in detail discounted cash-flow models and the many inputs required to build them; dividend discount models; the determination and use of relative-value multiples such as price/earnings and price/book value; and finally, how to apply option theory to specific problems in valuation. The course includes a special session on valuation approaches and challenges specific to venture capital and private-equity investing. This will include a discussion of topics such as required internal rates of return (IRRs), the effects of leverage on valuation, and issues relating to the valuation of high-growth startups.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":350667,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6630","titleShort":"Managerial Decision Making","titleLong":"Managerial Decision Making","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13260,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jer9","firstName":"J.","middleName":"","lastName":"Russo"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***JOHNSON AND GRAD STUDENTS ONLY*** \nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students â August 15th at 8:00am thru September 5th at 4:00pm.

The first is to convey an enduring understanding of decision concepts, skills, and tools that, taken as a whole, comprise a troubleshooter's guide to dealing with the uncertainty, complexity, and conflict of the professional world. The second is to provide a framework for a good decision process in which all of the decision concepts, skills, and tools fit coherently.

In general, an organization cannot survive without the trust of numerous stakeholders, and ethical lapses destroy trust and threaten vital stakeholder relationships. In today's volatile and fiercely competitive business environment, a manager must be able to identify and effectively resolve ethical issues that inevitably arise in the pursuit of business (and career) objectives. This course is designed to enhance students' skills in moral reasoning as it applies to managerial decision making. It begins by examining normative concepts and principles that typically enter into moral reasoning, then uses those concepts and principles to analyze cases. Discussions are designed to help students understand the moral issues confronting the decision makers in the cases and explore how those issues might be addressed in ethically responsible ways.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":350704,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6730","titleShort":"Derivatives Securities Part I","titleLong":"Derivatives Securities Part I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15530,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"10/06/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":13,"netid":"dh634","firstName":"Darien","middleName":"","lastName":"Huang"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***GM, GR and UG Srs/Jrs Only***\n** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\nDeadline to Change Grading Option: September 19th\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students â August 15th at 8:00am thru September 5th at 4:00pm.
