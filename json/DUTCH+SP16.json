Students will be reading two novels, which are both considered to be cornerstones of Dutch literature; both deal with crucial historical events. After finishing each novel, students will see the film adaptation of these novels. Students will prepare and read the novels in installments at home, and will get a deep understanding of the historical background of the events described in the novels in class. Relevant Dutch history will be highlighted through background readings and video.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"Satisfies Option 1.","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"This course is part of the Shared Course Initiative and will be taught from Columbia University using videoconferencing technology.

Each week we read a different text, mainly from the 17th century, based on students' needs: topics of texts typically cover art history, law, history, literature etc.  These materials help students greatly with the difficult task of reading challenging printed and handwritten texts from the late 16th and 17th centuries. The course starts with an overview of reading strategies that students learn to apply when approaching texts written in the 1600's. As the semester progresses, we read more and more complex texts. The last two weeks of the semester are devoted to handwritten texts and students get an introduction to various hands. The goal of the course is to prepare students for archival research.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Texts in Dutch, taught in English. This course is part of the Shared Course Initiative and will be taught from Columbia University using Videoconferencing technology.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: four semesters of Dutch or German language or equivalent.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"}]
