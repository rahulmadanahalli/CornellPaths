Michelangelo invented grandiose projects for ambitious patrons and created a novel visual language with parallels to his poetry, and in his later years, profoundly spiritual images. Raphael, the consummate court artist, antiquarian, and archaeologist, produced a new classical style. Leonardo and Michelangelo pioneered new approaches to the study and representation of the human body. They deployed wit and humor and reinvented the grotesque from ancient art, and all influenced the proliferation of erotic art. Biographies presented them as geniuses, leading the Florentine sculptor Cellini to model himself in his autobiography on a larger-than-life Michelangelo. Florentine painters and sculptors grappled with Michelangelo's enormous inventiveness.

We will also discuss more recent films with surprising links to both film noir and German expressionism, including Blue Velvet (1986), Dark City (1998), and The Big Lebowski (1998).

We begin with politically-charged Montmartre cabarets—Le Chat Noir, Moulin Rouge—where shadow theater, acrobats, and quadrille dancers inspired the street posters of Toulouse-Lautrec, Steinlin, and Vallotton. We follow their influence to James Ensor's Ostend carnivals and Les XX (The Twenty), the painters' coalition dedicated to the Belgian Workers Party, and then look at fin-de-siècle print culture through Redon's haunting \"noirs,\" lithographic albums inspired by Poe's tales of horror. We consider the Pont Aven Symbolists' turn from material to dream worlds visualized through stained glass and medieval tapestry; the close ties between Neo-impressionist painters and anarchist art critics; the Nabis (Prophets) pre-cinematic crowd scenes and the Lumière Brothers; and why the Nabis Vuillard and Bonnard abandoned their easels for costume and set design at the Théâtre d'Art. We consider the 1889 exposition universelle and the pavilions that fueled mass colonial fantasies and Gauguin's departure for Tahiti. Woven throughout are larger performances of decadence, crowds, and hysteria as modernity, and tensions between industrial life and utopic longing that led Symbolists to read Monet's Giverny grainstacks series as cosmic orbs, \"the terrestrial life of the globe and the course of earth through space.\" We will see the epoch illumined by marvel—electric lighting, phantasmagoria, Jules Verne's voyages, and Méliès' enchanted cinema.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":354588,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4210","titleShort":"Dance Technique IV/Classical","titleLong":"Dance Technique IV/Classical","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"STU","ssrComponentLong":"Studio","section":"501","classNbr":5367,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:50PM","timeEnd":"06:20PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"pbs6","firstName":"P.","middleName":"","lastName":"Suber"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts 320","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZ320","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Course fee of $40."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["STU"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"PE","catalogNbr":"1184","type":"B"},{"subject":"PE","catalogNbr":"1186","type":"B"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"3210","type":"B"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"4210","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Advanced and pre-professional Western classical dance.

From their headquarters in Amsterdam and Delft, respectively, they develop contrasting studio practices and relations with the market, and explore different subjects and mediums. Topics will include: investigations of the uses of light; methods of self-representation; depictions of women and the domestic sphere; Rembrandt's experiments in etching and Vermeer's with the camera obscura and opticality; and their histories of reception, including the consequential results of the Rembrandt Research Project.

Charting the advent and defining principles of performance studies, this course explores the interdisciplinary history of the field, including its association with anthropology, visual studies, theater, gender studies, sociology, psychology, literature, philosophy, and critical race studies. This class examines performance as a means of creative expression, a mode of critical inquiry, and an avenue for public engagement. We will attend to both the practice of performance - as gesture, behavior, habit, event, artistic expression, and social drama - and the study of performance - through ethnographic observation, spectatorship, documentation, reproduction, analysis, and writing strategies. Through a study of research paradigms and key issues related to performance, we will explore not only what this highly contested term \"is\" and \"does,\" but when and how, for whom, and under what circumstances.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":355388,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"6174","titleShort":"Introduction To Film Analysis","titleLong":"Introduction to Film Analysis: Meaning and Value","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":7727,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:35PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"crw225","firstName":"Chelsea","middleName":"R.","lastName":"Wessels"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts B21","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZB21","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"2540","type":"B"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"6540","type":"B"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"2174","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Intensive consideration of the ways films generate meaning and of the ways we attribute meaning and value to films.
