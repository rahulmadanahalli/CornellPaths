Each individual's personality is the culmination of his or her genetic makeup, biology, early life experiences, learning and culture. In this undergraduate-level course, we will review the major theories and research paradigms (e.g., trait, biological, cognitive) of modern-day personality psychology. The course will emphasize contemporary research, theory, and methodology, as well as provide a review of historical accounts that have significantly contributed to current conceptualizations.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Recommended prerequisite: introductory psychology or human development course.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"HE"},{"strm":2594,"crseId":358513,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"HD","catalogNbr":"4200","titleShort":"Risk&Rational Decision Mkg","titleLong":"Risk and Rational Decision Making","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"100","classNbr":1324,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:15PM","timeEnd":"03:45PM","startDt":"05/27/2015","endDt":"06/19/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"cfc53","firstName":"Christina","middleName":"French","lastName":"Chick"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall 157","bldgDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MVR157","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.
