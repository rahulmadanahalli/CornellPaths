The course also depicts popular culture as \"contested terrain,\" the place where social classes, racial and ethnic groups, women and men, the powerful and less powerful seek to \"control\" images and themes. Topics include The Honeymooners and 1950s television, soap operas; \"gross-out\" movies; Elvis; the Beatles, and Guns 'n Roses; gothic romances; and People Magazine and USA Today.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2594,"crseId":357918,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3128","titleShort":"America's Changing Faces","titleLong":"America's Changing Faces","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1492,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"06:30PM","timeEnd":"09:30PM","startDt":"06/08/2015","endDt":"07/31/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"df296","firstName":"Daniella","middleName":"","lastName":"Fridl"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Wolpe Center 118","bldgDescr":"Wolpe Center","facilityDescrshort":"WLP118","meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in Washington, DC.
