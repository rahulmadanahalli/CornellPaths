This entails reading some seminal pieces and broad overview articles that will cover the classic areas of research in the field. We will also read new research papers hot off the press and cutting-edge papers that reanalyze and reframe many of the classic variables of micro-OB, trying to alter the dominant perspective, bring in new theory, and integrate conflicting approaches. Be forewarned that achievement of these course objectives will require a significant, yet manageable, amount of reading. It is critical that you read the assigned materials before class and spend some time thinking about the implications of the readings, both separately and as a collection. We will use these readings to gain a sense of the theoretical progress of and diversity in the field, not as a set of findings that are simply to be digested or summated.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":365182,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NRE","catalogNbr":"5280","titleShort":"PhD Sem in Emp.
