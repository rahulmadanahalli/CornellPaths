Many in the Middle and on the Right in America, educational reformers of all stripes, blame teachers, their unions, and collective bargaining for these \"failures.\" Their \"solutions,\" which we will carefully examine, include charter schools, testing of students, unilaterally created evaluations of teachers, and severe restrictions on collective bargaining. This course will address, through policy, legal, and political readings, what forms this struggle is taking in US public education and its workplaces. It will focus, in large part, on the sharpening conflict between the goals, agendas, and hopes of public school workers who now face challenges from politicians and liberal and conservative critics who see much to gain by arguing that public education success requires significant limitations of the bargaining and economic rights and power of teacher unions and their members. Graduate and undergraduate students from all colleges are encouraged to enroll.

In addition to focusing on how arbitrators manage hearings, the course will also cover the institutional and administrative arrangements that support the use of labor arbitration. How arbitrators are admitted to rosters and receive appointments from such \"providers\" as the American Arbitration Association, the Federal Mediation &amp; Conciliation Service, the New York State Public Employment Relations Board, the Cornell's ADR Services, etc.) will be examined. The rules used by Cornell and other providers will also be discussed.  The first day will conclude with a labor arbitration exercise and faculty debriefing.\nDuring the next segments of the course, students will examine contemporary practice issues such as discovery, subpoenas, pre-hearing briefs, and problems involving availability of witnesses. Detailed coverage of the standards of contract interpretation, discipline and the role of evidence will be provided. Throughout the course, role-plays and other assignments will test students' understanding of the critical role of the arbitrator in deciding labor disputes. All case examples will be drawn from actual disputes successfully arbitrated by the course's instructor.\nCourse requirements include a writing assignment assessing labor arbitration as a technique for resolving workplace disputes between employers and unions. Required reading assignments will be drawn from the specialized literature on arbitration and dispute resolution.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":350419,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"6022","titleShort":"Arbitration","titleLong":"Arbitration","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15165,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rll5","firstName":"Risa","middleName":"L.","lastName":"Lieberwitz"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 111","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS111","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"4022","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Study of arbitration in the field of labor-management relations, including an analysis of principles and practices, the law of arbitration, the handling of materials in briefs and oral presentations, the conduct of mock arbitration hearing, and the preparation of arbitration opinions and post-hearing briefs.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with ILRLR 4022.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: ILRLR 5000 and ILRLR 5010.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":365472,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"6023","titleShort":"Mediation: Theory and Practice","titleLong":"Mediation: Theory and Practice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16375,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:00PM","timeEnd":"10:00PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rms43","firstName":"Rocco","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Scanza"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 112","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS112","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6080","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course is offered to students interested in acquiring thorough knowledge of the theory and practice of mediation as well as the techniques employed by effective mediators. In the first segment of the course, students will be introduced to the guiding principles of mediation and the concept of conflict. A review of the theories of conflict, its roots and its resolution, set the stage for the role mediation can effectively play in resolving conflict. Students are introduced to the models of mediation and the benefits and challenges of each, including a comparative analysis of evaluative, facilitative and transformative styles of mediation. In the second segment, students will examine the impact of federal and state laws on the process. Significant attention will be devoted to the use of mediation in the public and federal sectors and in public sector negotiation impasses. The course will also explore the use of mediation across industries, including construction, securities, and commercial disputes.  The role of gender, race, culture, ethics and impasse in mediation will all be examined and incorporated into workshops and case studies. Through a series of workshops, students will have several opportunities to apply their knowledge of mediation and begin to develop the skills needed to become effective mediators.
