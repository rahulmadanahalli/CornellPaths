As you analyze nakedness from ancient Greece to 21th century Africa, Asia, and Latin America, you will also be attentive to the variables of race, gender, and bodily abilities and how they complicate this mode of speaking. Primary texts include Devi's \"Draupadi,\" Ngugi's Wizard of the Crow, Andersen's The Emperor's New Clothes, Tennyson's \"Godiva,\" Auden's \"Cave of Nakedness,\" videos of Femen, gay parades, and Occupy Wall Street. You will read these visual and literary texts in conjunction with theoretical reflections on shame/injury, exposure, and humanity by Freud, Foucault, Derrida, Levinas, Nancy, and Berger. Assignments will clarify and build upon the readings and films and include reflection papers, analytical, and argumentative essays.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.

Additionally, we will spend time reading and thinking about secondary works which interrogate and historicize our principal terms.  By the end of the course, you will have read a substantial amount of important secondary work regarding mid-century masculinities, as well as a good selection of both canonical and less-known Victorian works.  The course will focus on novels  and secondary readings about gender and especially masculinity. Most of these readings will be critical and historical, rather than theoretical in the strict sense.

When architecture is understood as an organism, and the skin and structure of architecture as a system, the conflation of structure into the skin is a way of thinking of the architectural enclosure as a deep skin, and the individual parts of which an architectural skin is constructed, as a study of the tissue of structure. This seminar will  engage these ideas across a wide range of disciplines and topics including: the specular/reflecting skin, mediatic skins, metabolism and megastructures, the digital skin, the new grotesque, and Big Data and networked skins. The skin of architecture is the intersection of theory, materiality, affect, signification, and comfort.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.

This seminar develops a set of theoretical frameworks and methodologies for thinking about the ontologies, ecologies, and materialities of media with a particular focus on the relationship between media and the elemental world – the world of clouds, sediment, water, ecological systems, atmospheres, and bodies. How is an understanding of media in relation to elemental materiality transforming the ontological, ecological, intellectual, and political contours of media studies? To explore this topic, this seminar draws material from media studies and new materialism in conversation with perspectives in anthropology, science and technology studies, environmental studies, and art history, and philosophy.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.

Considering questions of performance, censorship, embodiment, pleasure, and representational politics, we will evaluate how race, particularly Black skin, has been used as a signifier and complex code for various things on screen. In doing so, we will investigate how blackness is contingent on the specifics of its historical, social, and cultural production and, yet, open to multiple and competing claims. Therefore, blackness here is less a stable racial category than theoretical motor, operated by moving and contested discourses, histories, images, meanings, and performances by Black subjects. Focusing on Black skin representation and discourses of blackness as a cultural signifier, students will watch and discuss important representations and misrepresentations of blackness on screen.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.
