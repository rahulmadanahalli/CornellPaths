We will review important archaeological sites such as Chaco Canyon, Cahokia, Lamoka Lake, and the Little Bighorn battlefield. A principal focus will be on major transformations in lifeways such as the adoption of agriculture, the development of political-economic hierarchies, and the disruptions that accompanied the arrival of Europeans to the continent.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AG, D-AG, HA-AG)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":352722,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"AIIS","catalogNbr":"2600","titleShort":"Intro To Native American Lits","titleLong":"Introduction to Native American Literature","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":4891,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"cew254","firstName":"Carol","middleName":"Edelman","lastName":"Warrior"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2600","type":"C"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"2600","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The production of North American Indigenous literatures began long before European colonization, and persists in a variety of printed, sung, carved, painted, written, spoken, and digital media. From oral traditions transmitted through memory and mnemonics to contemporary innovations, Native North American authorial techniques layer Indigenous perspectives on social, political, and environmental experience, through deft artistry and place-specific aesthetics. Our attention will focus on the relationships and contexts from which particular Native American literatures emerge, and ethical considerations associated with entering Indigenous territory, both figuratively and literally. In response to a selection of traditional stories, fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and a graphic novel or two, we will examine how Native literatures voice scathing critiques of settler-colonial values and practices, and yet challenge, delight, and intrigue their readers.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AG, D-AG, LA-AG)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":361756,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AIIS","catalogNbr":"3330","titleShort":"IndigenousPlace-BasedEcolKnowl","titleLong":"Ways of Knowing: Indigenous and Place-Based Ecological Knowledge","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":4176,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"ksk28","firstName":"Karim-Aly","middleName":"Saleh","lastName":"Kassam"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Enrollment limited to: Juniors, seniors, and grad students.
