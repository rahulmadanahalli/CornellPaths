Students learning the meanings of these elements and the rules of word formation can usually recognize the basic meaning of any unfamiliar word in these fields. This skill is especially valuable for pre-law, pre-medical, pre-dental, pre-veterinary students and for those in other health and legal fields, as well as for students who would like to broaden their general vocabulary. This course would be excellent preparation for students prior to taking standardized test: e.g., SAT, GRE, MCAT, TOEFL, LSAT, etc.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2664,"crseId":352314,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"CLASS","catalogNbr":"2604","titleShort":"Greek Mythology","titleLong":"Greek Mythology","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1157,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:00AM","timeEnd":"11:15AM","startDt":"06/26/2017","endDt":"08/04/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.
