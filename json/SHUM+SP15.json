We will address these and related questions through analytic discussion and writing about the legendary Edward R. Murrow's radio broadcasts during the Blitz of London in World War II, written accounts by Jewish children trapped in the Holocaust, and a report smuggled out of a Soviet labor camp for women political prisoners. We will also examine documentary films, oral testimony of Holocaust and Soviet camp survivors, and (if time permits) Internet reports on some recent hells.  ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366510,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SHUM","catalogNbr":"4991","titleShort":"Romanticism & Fate of Senses","titleLong":"Romanticism and the Fate of the Senses","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17030,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ajg348","firstName":"Amanda","middleName":"Jo","lastName":"Goldstein"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"A D White House 110","bldgDescr":"A D White House","facilityDescrshort":"ADW110","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4019","type":"C"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"4491","type":"C"},{"subject":"STS","catalogNbr":"4981","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"What if, William Blake once asked, every bird that flies \"is an immense world of delight, closed by your senses five?\" Asking what real and possible worlds our habits of sensory perception exclude, Romantic poets criticized their culture's increasing faith in sense-based, empirical knowledge - knowledge supposedly free from subjective bias, historical circumstance, national prejudice, and political complicity.

Focusing on Classical art, this course explores the role of touch and embodiment in the viewing and reception of art objects, drawing on ancient models of sense-perception as well as 20th Century theorists such as Reigl, Berenson and Merleau-Ponty.  ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366522,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SHUM","catalogNbr":"4998","titleShort":"Feeling in Sound","titleLong":"Feeling in Sound: Touch and the New Musical Body","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17033,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"ar34","firstName":"Annette","middleName":"","lastName":"Richards"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"A D White House 110","bldgDescr":"A D White House","facilityDescrshort":"ADW110","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4029","type":"C"},{"subject":"MUSIC","catalogNbr":"4334","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar explores musical, aesthetic, physiological, and mythical  concepts associated with 'touch' in music.

The four interrelated units focus on: 1) the clavichord and 18th-century concepts of sympathetic vibration; 2) the glass harmonica and physiology of the nervous system; 3) technologies of touch in the 19th century and the disciplining of the hand; and 4) the absent or fantastic touch and its relation to music-making at early 20th-century electronic instruments.
