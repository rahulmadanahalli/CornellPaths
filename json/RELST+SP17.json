In order to get a sense of the experiences treated in classical religious texts, students will be expected to experiment with some basic meditation practices. At least as important for the work of the course (and much more important for the grade) will be the ways in which students situate these practices within larger South Asian world views as suggested by doctrines, rituals, iconic forms, and literary texts. To keep the interaction between internal practice and broader world views central, we will examine both Hindu and Buddhist sources, consistently examining the ways in which similar practices are given distinct shapes by the two religious traditions.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":365250,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"RELST","catalogNbr":"2575","titleShort":"Myth & Religion in Mesopotamia","titleLong":"Myth and Religion in Mesopotamia","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":8009,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jst229","firstName":"Jonathan","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Tenney"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Morrill Hall 106","bldgDescr":"Morrill Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MRL106","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"2575","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"2575","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"6575","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course will survey the cultic practices and beliefs of ancient Babylonia and Assyria, the two major civilizations of Mesopotamia.

The flight of the gods and the death of God have supposedly left a disenchanted world with little room for the sacred. However, in this class we will study modern European writers, artists, and philosophers who rejected conventional religion but held fast to a concept of the divine or the holy. In particular, we will trace the desire for a \"new mythology\" and examine critically the transition from religious art to art as religion, in which the artistic genius is deified. Were these currents radical or reactionary? Are enchantment and enthusiasm compatible with atheism and materialism? What is the price of Enlightenment and what are the risks of resisting it? Helping us answer these questions will be authors like Blake, Hölderlin, Wackenroder, Baudelaire, Mallarmé, Yeats, George, Rilke, and Mann. We will also read philosophy by Nietzsche, Heidegger, Eliade, Blumenberg, Girard, and Derrida.

This course is being taught both as an integrated arts in the curriculum course in collaboration with the Johnson Art Museum and is also part of a \"Internationalizing the Cornell Curriculum Grant\".  An optional 10-day trip to Japan to spend time in Zen temples and a monastery will be offered to students.  Furthermore, students studying Japanese  language can sign up for an optional 1-credit language course exploring Zen practice and arts vocabulary (JAPAN 2216).","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(KCM-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":350732,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"RELST","catalogNbr":"3420","titleShort":"Myth, Ritual, and Symbol","titleLong":"Myth, Ritual, and Symbol","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16919,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ceg97","firstName":"Chris","middleName":"","lastName":"Garces"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Morrill Hall 106","bldgDescr":"Morrill Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MRL106","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"201","classNbr":16920,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:00AM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"McGraw Hall 215","bldgDescr":"McGraw Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MCG215","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"202","classNbr":16921,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"McGraw Hall 215","bldgDescr":"McGraw Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MCG215","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC","DIS"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"3420","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Examines how systems of thought, symbolic forms, and ritual practice are formulated and expressed in primarily non-Western societies.

You will also gain a deeper appreciation of the various kinds of evidence and disciplinary approaches that need to be brought to bear on the attempt to articulate as broad, deep and varied a phenomenon as modern Hasidic Judaism. ","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":367449,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"RELST","catalogNbr":"6616","titleShort":"Zen Buddhism: Food,Tea,Hosp","titleLong":"Zen Buddhism: Food, Tea and Hospitality in Praxis","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":9344,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jml16","firstName":"Jane-Marie","middleName":"","lastName":"Law"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Rockefeller Hall 102","bldgDescr":"Rockefeller Hall","facilityDescrshort":"RCK102","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jml16","firstName":"Jane-Marie","middleName":"","lastName":"Law"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Rockefeller Hall 128","bldgDescr":"Rockefeller Hall","facilityDescrshort":"RCK128","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"3316","type":"B"},{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"6616","type":"B"},{"subject":"RELST","catalogNbr":"3416","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course explores the Zen's central religious, historical and aesthetic developments. We read primary sources in translation and secondary sources. We examine the rise of the Ch'an tradition in China and the development of Northern and Southern Schools. In Japan, we examine the establishment of Zen in the Kamakura period, through the development of both Rinzai and Soto Zen, and early transmissions of Chinese texts and practices to Japan through Japanese emissaries. We study the lives and writings of Eisai and Dôgen, and explore how their works influenced later developments in Zen. Next we read works by Hakuin. Last, we study how Zen is implicated in Japanese fascism and later, postwar identity discourses. Finally, we look at Zen in an American context. This course is being taught both as an integrated arts in the curriculum course in collaboration with the Johnson Art Museum and is also part of a \"Internationalizing the Cornell Curriculum Grant\".  An optional 10-day trip to Japan to spend time in Zen temples and a monastery will be offered to students.  Furthermore, students studying Japanese  language can sign up for an optional 1-credit language course exploring Zen practice and arts vocabulary (JAPAN 2216).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":353560,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"RELST","catalogNbr":"6618","titleShort":"Sem Early Islamic Hist 600-750","titleLong":"Seminar in Islamic History: 600-750","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16589,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":6,"netid":"dsp4","firstName":"David","middleName":"Stephan","lastName":"Powers"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"White Hall 106","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT106","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"4614","type":"B"},{"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"6710","type":"B"},{"subject":"MEDVL","catalogNbr":"4618","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"4618","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"6618","type":"B"},{"subject":"RELST","catalogNbr":"4618","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"An examination of Islamic history from 600-750, with special attention to historiography and interpretive issues.
