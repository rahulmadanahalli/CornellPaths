These include (among others) customers, investors, employees, vendors, governments, local communities, and advocacy groups. Maintaining the trust of these constituencies is vital to effective management-and to the health of the company itself. Such trust is undermined by actions stakeholders perceive as unfair or even unethical. Hence, hospitality and tourism managers must be able to identify and resolve tough ethical challenges posed by conflicting stakeholder interests. Moreover, they need to be able to recognize biases and other psychological traps that can result in unethical actions that threaten stakeholder relationships. This discussion-oriented course aims both to sharpen students' skills in ethical reasoning and to help them avoid cognitive pitfalls that can lead to ethically defective decisions. Making use of a variety of relevant concepts and principles, class discussion will critically examine ethical issues confronting managers in the hospitality and tourism industry and explore how those issues might be handled in ethically defensible ways.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.

The course will emphasize entrepreneurship as a manageable process that can be applied in virtually any organizational setting. Further, it is a course that mixes theory with practice, and you will be challenged to apply principles, concepts and frameworks to real world situations.

(It provides material that is distinct from that provided in ILRHR 6690 Managing Compensation.) Students will learn how to design a pay plan, including base pay and pay-for-performance plans. By the completion of the course, participants will know how to design pay ranges and grades for organizations where most jobs can be benchmarked with market data. The course will also devote considerable time to the design of incentive plans, including merit pay, bonuses, gainsharing, profit sharing, piece-rate, tipping, and commission systems. It is useful for those desiring employment as an entry-level compensation specialist, a HR generalist, those starting and running their own business, or those who want a better understanding of how HR practices are actually managed. For students with a particular interest in compensation, the course can be taken in addition to ILRHR 6690 (or other compensation courses available at Cornell); for those interested in compensation in the services industry, this course can be taken as a standalone course.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Elective.

They are given opportunities to practice advanced methods of investment management and securities trading with special applications to real estate, such as taking simultaneous long/short positions to achieve alpha while neutralizing systematic risk and using exchange-traded funds consisting of real estate securities to directly hedge long positions.  All types of residential and commercial real estate securities are analyzed, including those of hospitality firms.
