Taxes have a direct impact on cash flow and often divert 30 to 40 percent of the firm's pretax cash flow to the government, effectively making the government the single largest stakeholder in many firms. Having an understanding of taxation and how firms plan accordingly is important for just about any career path students choose, whether they will be an investment banker, venture capitalist, consultant, money manager, CFO, treasurer, controller, taking over a family-owned business, or an entrepreneur setting up a new business.

The attitudes, values, and practices that prevail in their organizations induce otherwise ethical employees to take actions that violate widely shared norms of conduct. Such behavior can be costly-even disastrous-leading to ruined careers, tarnished corporate reputations, and legal liability for the individuals and their companies. In an environment where \"only results matter,\" it can be difficult for a new MBA or law school graduate to recognize the risks. If she does see the dangers, she may still find it hard to avoid them.  This course seeks to help MBAs and law students understand how a firm's culture, combined with common human tendencies, can tempt-or push-employees into unethical behavior. It also considers how employees can meet ethical challenges posed by their firms' cultures. Class sessions include discussion of case studies and readings reporting on relevant research in psychology and organizational behavior, as well as talks by noted guest speakers from the worlds of business, law, journalism, and academia. The grade in the course is based on class participation and on two written case analyses, including a final project.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":361612,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5150","titleShort":"Leadership Theory & Practice","titleLong":"Leadership Theory and Practice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12846,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"03/03/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mjh35","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Hostetler"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B10","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB10","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"05:15PM","timeEnd":"08:05PM","startDt":"02/08/2016","endDt":"02/08/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mjh35","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Hostetler"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":3,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"03/10/2016","endDt":"03/24/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mjh35","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Hostetler"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":4,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"04/07/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mjh35","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Hostetler"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B06","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB06","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***NON-JOHNSON GRAD and UG SENIORS ONLY***\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Non-Johnson Students ONLY:  January 19th at 8:00am to February 10th at 4:00pm.

Retailing is not only a link in the supply chain, but also an important industry for a number of reasons. This industry, more than any other, is at the forefront of business changes since it directly connects with the consumer and generates demand for the rest of the economy. It is an intensely dynamic industry, with continuous changes in marketing channels, technology, and sourcing. It has gone through remarkable developments through history, and has often been an incubator for new business concepts. Currently, retailing is leading economic growth and transformation in emerging markets around the world, both through global sourcing and global marketing. In the US, retailing comprises 40% of the economy, and is the largest employer. Problems faced by retailers are shared by other firms in the economy, and retailers are often the dominant player in a supply chain. Thus, retailing is also academically interesting as a laboratory to learn and test concepts that may apply to other businesses. Various types of sophisticated data can be collected in retailing easier than in other industries. Performance can be measured accurately and rapidly. Managers in retailing can also change their strategies and product mix in relatively short periods of time. Finally, low entry and exit barriers magnify risks and rewards in this industry, so that we find firms with stellar growth as well those with a history of bankruptcies. We shall study all these different aspects of retail operations through case discussions and lectures.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":350106,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5240","titleShort":"Macroeconomics & Int'l Trade","titleLong":"Macroeconomics and International Trade","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12995,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"03/18/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"oh33","firstName":"Ori","middleName":"","lastName":"Heffetz"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B05","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB05","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"GM and Grad ONLY.

The Cornell Management Simulation elective course will give you the chance to form a team and run a company that will compete against your classmates in a simulated industry. At the beginning of the simulation, each team develops a strategy, and before the results of the last decision have been determined, presents an analysis of its performance, lessons learned, and its strategy for the future in a \"board of directors\" meeting. The first course meeting is 4 hours to introduce the simulation and its mechanics as well as a discussion of company strategy. Future meetings are weekly for 2 hours which includes time for teams to review their performance and work on their company decisions. Grades are based on the value created for the company's shareholders (relative to other firms in the same industry), the team's strategy, and the instructor's evaluation of team's performance at the board meeting. The course may be taken for a grade or pass/fail at the student's option.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":350305,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5730","titleShort":"Leading from the Inside-Out","titleLong":"Leading from the Inside-Out","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16286,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"05:40PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ccs7","firstName":"Clint","middleName":"","lastName":"Sidle"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 131","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH131","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Graduate and UG Srs Only\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Non-Johnson Students ONLY:  January 19th at 8:00am to February 10th at 4:00pm.

The graded work is a written proposal for an M&amp;A transaction between two existing companies in different countries prepared by small teams. Proposals are based on publicly available financial, business, legal, and other documents and data and any other information obtained. The goal of the written work is to simulate the process in which business people, investment bankers, and lawyers work together to structure transactions across national borders. The reading covers the basic business and legal issues most frequently encountered in international mergers and acquisitions. Class discussion occasionally refers to the reading but generally covers other issues.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":362024,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5920","titleShort":"Experience

Sessions will examine the constraints to entrepreneurs and the ways in which they obtain financing with a particular focus on venture capital and emerging markets. The course will use cases of successful entrepreneurs under the most difficult circumstances and will address entrepreneurship in a serious downturn and networking across borders. In addition to common issues related to starting a business and investing in it, the class will address issues not normally on the radar screen of U.S. entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. The course will draw on the experience of investors and entrepreneurs, cases prepared especially for this course, as well as findings reported in the research literature. This course is meant to be in part a practical guide to students who wish to be entrepreneurs outside the United States or to create cross-border businesses. It may be of interest to people working in entrepreneurial environments in other organizations or students who want to get involved in various forms of financing entrepreneurial ventures. Students may use the course to explore development of a business concept or plan outside (at least in part) the United States. There will be a particular concentration on Asia, the role of government in stimulating entrepreneurship and venture capital and the nitty-gritty issues of valuing young and private firms sharing profits, raising resources, and organizing and managing human resources.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: At least one finance or economics class.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":367961,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5940","titleShort":"Mergers & Acquisitions","titleLong":"Mergers and Acquisitions - Accounting, Modeling and Evaluation of Deals","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18635,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:00PM","timeEnd":"05:30PM","startDt":"03/11/2016","endDt":"03/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":10,"netid":"rbr77","firstName":"Radha","middleName":"Balkrishna","lastName":"Radhakrishna"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B05","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB05","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"12:30PM","startDt":"03/12/2016","endDt":"03/12/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"S","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B05","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB05","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Add/Drop dates:   Johnson Students - January 19th at 8:00am thru February 10th or prior to first class if class is held before these dates.

Electronic commerce involves a wide variety of cooperating technologies (e.g., communications, networks, databases, expert systems, and multimedia) and affects a wide variety of managerial issues. It created a new emphasis on information technologies and systems in management; led to the development of new technologies and new combinations of existing technologies to support management; and occasionally radically altered business practices and the role of management. Students in this course learn to conduct economic transactions and manage businesses on the Internet.

The broad objective is to provide a fundamental understanding of marketing research methods employed by better-managed firms or proposed by leading academicians. The course is aimed at the manager, the ultimate user of marketing information, who is responsible for the scope and direction of research activities involved in obtaining, analyzing, and interpreting results of research. Covers the use of secondary sources of marketing information as well as qualitative research for designing studies and collecting primary data. Students are exposed to up-to-date methods in research design, qualitative research, measurement, data collection, and analysis. The emphasis is more on evaluating research methods and on interpretation and use of results, and less on mathematical derivations. Students are also exposed to the practical side of marketing research through case studies, problem sets, and projects.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: NCC 5010, NCC 5030, or equivalent.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":366904,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6320","titleShort":"Core Ldrship Skills for VUCA","titleLong":"Core Leadership Skills for a VUCA World","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":14983,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:00PM","timeEnd":"03:00PM","startDt":"01/29/2016","endDt":"02/05/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"gwc65","firstName":"George","middleName":"W.","lastName":"Casey"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B08","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB08","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"10:00AM","timeEnd":"01:00PM","startDt":"01/30/2016","endDt":"02/06/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"gwc65","firstName":"George","middleName":"W.","lastName":"Casey"}],"pattern":"S","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B08","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB08","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Add/Drop dates:   Johnson Students - January 19th at 8:00am thru February 10th or prior to first class if class is held before these dates.

The quantitative trading strategies are based on time-series and cross-sectional return predictability on global financial assets such as equity indices, foreign currencies, commodities, and sovereign bonds. In particular, we study the fundamentals of commodity futures returns and momentum strategy on commodity investment, the carry trade and momentum strategy on currency investment, the volatility strategy on option investment. In addition to delivering trading strategies, we pay close attention to common risk factors behind these investment strategies. Special topics change from one year to another to reflect recent trends and practices in industry, and also the state-of-art research in academia. This year's special topics are stock crash concerns and expected returns, rare disaster concerns and hedge fund performance, and global tail risks across different asset classes.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":350631,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6470","titleShort":"Advanced Spreadsheet Modeling","titleLong":"Advanced Spreadsheet Modeling","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17359,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"03/18/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lwr2","firstName":"Lawrence","middleName":"W.","lastName":"Robinson"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 257-Parker","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH257","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Pre-Req:  NBA 6430\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 19th at 8:00am to February 10th at Noon.  \nNon-Johnson Students:  February 4th at 8:00am to February 10th at 4:00pm.  \nYou may add or drop a first-half class after February 10th with permission of the faculty.

Three methods of valuation are introduced: intrinsic valuation, relative valuation by multiples using comparables, and contingent claims valuation, based on a real options approach. The rest of the course will be dedicated to understanding each of these methods in greater detail and more importantly, applying them to the valuation of actual companies. This will involve understanding in detail discounted cash-flow models and the many inputs required to build them; dividend discount models; the determination and use of relative-value multiples such as price/earnings and price/book value; and finally, how to apply option theory to specific problems in valuation. The course includes a special session on valuation approaches and challenges specific to venture capital and private-equity investing. This will include a discussion of topics such as required internal rates of return (IRRs), the effects of leverage on valuation, and issues relating to the valuation of high-growth startups.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":364724,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6620","titleShort":"Product Marketing Insights","titleLong":"Product Marketing Insights","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12962,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"03/14/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mkt27","firstName":"Manoj","middleName":"","lastName":"Thomas"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B09","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB09","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"03/21/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mkt27","firstName":"Manoj","middleName":"","lastName":"Thomas"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B05","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB05","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Add/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 19th at 8:00am to February 10th at 4:00pm.  \nNon-Johnson Students:  February 4th at 8:00am to February 10th at 4:00pm.  \nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 10th with permission of the faculty.

In the past, some students from the Engineering, Hotel, AEM (Dyson) and ILR programs have also attended this course. Impactful business leaders appreciate the importance of consumer insights. Many strategic decisions - such as introducing a new product, repositioning an existing product, or deciding whether to extend an existing brand or to introduce a new brand - are pivoted on consumer insights. In this course I will discuss how managers can uncover behavioral insights and use those insights to shape product marketing strategy. The course will cover the following four topics: CONSUMER INSIGHTS (What is consumer insight? What research methods can be used to uncover consumer insights?), POSITIONING &amp; BRANDING (Can you do the financial analysis required for a marketing plan? Why is positioning so important? Which segment should you target? Can intangible brand associations influence market shares? Should you extend your brand?  How is brand value measured?), INNOVATION (Do you have to be a pioneer to successfully innovate? How can new product diffusion be modeled? Is your category lifecycle slow-and-long or fast-and-short? How to test a concept? How can you optimize the attributes of your new concept? How can you forecast the sales of the new product?), PRICING &amp; ADVERTISING (Will a higher price help or hurt your brand? Does share-of-voice predict market share?). Please note that there is a significant overlap between the material taught in this course and the Strategic Brand Management course (NBA 6240) taught by me in the Strategic Marketing Immersion program. Therefore students, who have already attended the Strategic Marketing Immersion course will not be allowed to enroll for this course.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":350671,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6650","titleShort":"Strat Mgmt of Tech & Innov","titleLong":"The Strategic Management of Technology and Innovation","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12863,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"05:40PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":11,"netid":"rll36","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"Louis","lastName":"Laperle"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Open to GM and Grad Students Only \nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 19th at 8:00am to February 10th at 4:00pm.  \nNon-Johnson Students:  February 4th at 8:00am to February 10th at 4:00pm.  \nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 10th with permission of the faculty.

This course is designed for students who may someday work in, consult for, and/or create firms whose primary product is fundamentally related to technology or innovation. The course typically includes both M.B.A. students and graduate students in science. It starts by examining how industries are transformed by new technologies and how these patterns of industrial change generate both opportunity and high rates of firm failure. We will then explore the questions: Why do some technology leaders fail? and How do technology innovators successfully take on and replace incumbent firms? This leads to an examination of internal management issues, focusing on the design of innovative organizations: designing reward systems, managing growth, overcoming resistance to change, and using organizational culture to promote innovation.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":350684,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6680","titleShort":"Advanced Oral Communications","titleLong":"Advanced Oral Communications","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17982,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"03/21/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":12,"netid":"bem5","firstName":"Barbara","middleName":"E.","lastName":"Mink"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"anj1","firstName":"Angela","middleName":"","lastName":"Noble-Grange"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 131","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH131","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Pre-req:  NBA 5680 or NBA 5660\r\n***MUST ATTEND FIRST CLASS***.\r\nNon-Johnson students must see their college registrar regarding policies connected with adding/dropping a second half Johnson School class.

It provides a method for identifying optimal strategies and predicting the outcomes of strategic interactions. Using lectures, in-class games, and assignments, this course develops the basic tools of game theory as they relate to business situations, and then applies them real-world cases. Topics include strategic cooperation and punishment between firms, strategic commitments, predatory and limit pricing, entry deterrence, and auctions. The final deliverable is a take-home essay in which you apply the course material to a game theoretic setting of your choice. This course requires only basic mathematics skills, but a familiarity with microeconomics and strategy is recommended.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":351774,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6980","titleShort":"WTO & International Trade Law","titleLong":"WTO and International Trade Law","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18297,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:35AM","timeEnd":"10:00AM","startDt":"01/25/2016","endDt":"04/29/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ct343","firstName":"Chantal","middleName":"","lastName":"Thomas"}],"pattern":"RF","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 186","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH186","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6981","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The law of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including international trade theory, the WTO dispute settlement process, and the basic WTO rules and nondiscrimination principles limiting national trade policy.
