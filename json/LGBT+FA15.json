Using an interdisciplinary approach (literature, history, anthropology, media, law, and science), we will explore categories such as sexual norms, human rights, power, feminism, queerness, gender/sex, censorship/ moral panic, and identity in Euro-American as well as in postcolonial and global terms. Through a variety of films, primary and secondary sources, you will formulate questions and provide answers to the relationship of these categories with organizing structures, including race, ethnicity, religion, family, marriage, reproduction, the economy, and the state. While we investigate how sexual identities in African, South American, and Asian contexts converge with or challenge Euro-American discourses, we will look at the tools LGBT studies offers for understanding power and culture. Course requirements include reading responses, blackboard discussions, and two short papers.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Understand

abuse.  The Obama administration responded by detaining these families in prison-like conditions for months, often denying them release on bond and inhibiting their ability to apply for political asylum.  This course examines these issues in historical, political, and social contexts, analyzing U.S. immigration policy and activist responses to this current crisis.  We will work in conjunction with a group of lawyers who represent families held in detention centers in Texas, and will integrate readings from within the fields of transnational feminism, critical legal studies, and immigrant
