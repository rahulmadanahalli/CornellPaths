Hipster Brooklyn. Immigrant Brooklyn. Brownstone Brooklyn. While today Brooklyn is New York City's hippest borough and the site of swift gentrification, booming real estate, and the ever-escalating displacement of immigrant and Black communities, in the 1980s and 1990s it was a hotbed of hip hop music, making the borough synonymous with Black cultural production. New York's most populous borough is still the home of the nation's most concentrated Black population. This course borrows from hip hop's notion of \"representing\" to explore popular and cultural understandings of race and place in Brooklyn as depicted in print, music, and film. How is Brooklyn represented? What do these representations reveal about Black cultural production, inequality and transnational identity formation more broadly speaking? Spanning the period from 1945 to the present day, emphases will include the grassroots movements of the 1960s-1970s, the commodification of hip hop in the 1980s-1990s, and close readings of iconic Brooklyn films such as Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing,\" to reflect on how Black popular culture engages with Brooklyn's many ethnic groups. While materials are interdisciplinary in approach, our investigation is informed by anthropological, historical, and literary texts covering topics including immigration, transnationalism, gentrification, and gendered and racialized inequality.

But how did these images affect the roles that black men and women played on and off the screen and the portrayal of the black body in contemporary society? This interdisciplinary course explores the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in addressing the body in art, film, photography and the media.

This decade marks one of the most turbulent periods in American history and radical changes impacting the political, religious, artistic, legal and educational cultures of Black people occurred during the period. For the most part we take these changes for granted without giving much thought to their origins.

This decade marks one of the most turbulent periods in American history and radical changes impacting the political, religious, artistic, legal and educational cultures of Black people occurred during the period. For the most part we take these changes for granted without giving much thought to their origins. Through a variety of readings, discussions, and research papers, and through the screening of documentaries, the course aims to explore and arrive at a deeper understanding of the major events of the period and to understand how structural issues impacted the lives of African Americans, as well as how they responded to these upheavals.

Beginning with a study of Emerson, we will explore classical and contemporary statements of pragmatism and their political consequences. Among other topics we will discuss action, inquiry, belief, faith, and power. We will also consider the attempts of other twentieth-century thinkers to rethink the nature of experience and its relationship to politics, including Bergson, Du Bois, and Whitehead.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":364119,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"6612","titleShort":"Colonial American Literature","titleLong":"Colonial American Literature","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16454,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"etc7","firstName":"Eric","middleName":"T.","lastName":"Cheyfitz"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Stimson Hall 105","bldgDescr":"Stimson Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STM105","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"6612","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The American Revolution was a war fought by European settlers against England that ended the colonial domination of these settlers in the founding of the United States.
