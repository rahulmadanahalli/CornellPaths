This course combines acting and movement techniques encouraging process-oriented work. Focusing on performance in civic spaces, the class works to examine the politics of status and the social role of bodily (including vocal) expression of both performer and audience.  Working within the specific context of urban public spaces, the class will question the function of monument and the character of urbanism in relation to individual bodies while understanding how these bodies combine to create a body politic. The class will consider traditional tools of political and social satire, including Commedia dellArte.  Fundamental in commedia is the exploration of status, the gradation of power and influence and role-playing. Students will create their own texts and movement as well as draw from other textual and visual sources. The class will conclude with a public performance.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"(GA)(EP)","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2594,"crseId":359606,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"3380","titleShort":"Ancient/Modern Corpo-realit","titleLong":"Ancient/Modern Corpo-Realities","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1445,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:00AM","timeEnd":"12:00PM","startDt":"06/30/2015","endDt":"07/28/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"pbs6","firstName":"P.","middleName":"","lastName":"Suber"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Offered in Rome.

Topics include examination of the ways in which class relates to social and public space and urban space as performance. Additional course work in film production, performance, and writing allows students to re-inscribe their spatial/corporeal experiences into an alternative exhibition space of the city street or the written page. In addition, each student will be required to produce formal textual documentation and full textual analyses of this process and final performance, installation, or text-based product.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"(HTC)","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2594,"crseId":359607,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"3436","titleShort":"Location/European Film Hist","titleLong":"Location of European Film History","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1449,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:00PM","timeEnd":"06:00PM","startDt":"06/30/2015","endDt":"07/28/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"pbs6","firstName":"P.","middleName":"","lastName":"Suber"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Offered in Rome.

Examination of Italian Neorealism and French Poetic Realism and Nouveau Vague are central in this course that seeks to test the thesis that locations matter; that place and its representation are not arbitrary or insignificant. Students are encouraged to consider the mutual material implication obtained among aesthetic practices and urban sites and structures. Screenings and site visits of film locations are required. Students are also required to keep a journal and complete in a final written project consisting of short and long essay questions.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"}]
