Nearly every American leader has fought in or run a war, whether that leader was a founding father or our first African-American President. This course will look not only at the military history of US wars but at the leadership — Hamilton, Lincoln, Obama as well as George Patton, Colin Powell, and Chris Kyle — that organized and defined how the wars started, happened, and ended. The class will tour nearby battlefields, including such critical Civil War sites as Antietam and Gettysburg, to understand the conflicts not only on the top level but down on the battleground itself.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"Also offered as a distance learning course.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2664,"crseId":367904,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"1591","titleShort":"Global Approach Modern Chinese","titleLong":"A Global Approach to Modern Chinese History","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1287,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:30AM","timeEnd":"12:45PM","startDt":"06/26/2017","endDt":"08/04/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.
