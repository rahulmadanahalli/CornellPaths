This course introduces students to ongoing social scientific debates about the sources and consequences of inequality, as well as the types of public policy that might appropriately be pursued to reduce (or increase) inequality. These topics will be addressed in related unites, some of which include guest lectures by faculty from other universities (funded by the Center for the Study of Inequality).

It can be planned or unplanned, proactive or reactive, and it can involve fundamental transformation or only incremental adjustments. This course examines organizational change from both a theoretical and practical perspective. To do so, the course pairs readings drawn from Sociology and Social Psychology with case studies and in-class exercises that put you inside real organizations and give you experience making decisions in the face of ambiguous and incomplete information. We focus first on the tensions that arise when establishing and changing the design and structure of an organization. Next, we consider change in organizational culture-the assumptions, norms, and practices shared by members or a group or organization. In the final module, we examine how individuals within organizations lead and manage change.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: ILROB 1220.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":355543,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILROB","catalogNbr":"3290","titleShort":"Organizational Cultures","titleLong":"Organizational Cultures","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15128,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"wjs7","firstName":"William","middleName":"James","lastName":"Sonnenstuhl"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 111","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS111","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Reviews the concept of culture as it has evolved in sociology and anthropology, applying it to formal organizations in workplaces such as corporations and unions. The course first examines the nature of ideologies as sense-making definitions of behavior, concentrating on the cultural forms that carry these cultural messages, rituals, symbols, myths, sagas, legends, and organizational stories. Considerable attention is given to rites and ceremonials as a cultural form in organizational life that consolidates many of these expressive forms into one. The course examines types of ceremonial behavior such as rites of passage, rites of enhancement, and rites of degradation, including the role of language gestures, physical settings, and artifacts in ceremonial behavior. The presence of subcultures and countercultures in organizational behavior also receive attention, especially the part played by occupational subcultures in formal organizations.
