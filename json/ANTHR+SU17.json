Like all animals, humans are selected by evolution to care for their offspring, but human infants and children require more intense parental investment than the offspring of most other species. Why is this so? Human parents are also influenced by cultural belief systems and ideology that play out in parenting styles. How do various belief systems influence parent-offspring interaction? In this course we will examine the human infant as a biologically designed organism that has co-evolved with caretakers, and then look at the various parenting styles across cultures that also mold our young.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2664,"crseId":366963,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"4496","titleShort":"The Food You Eat","titleLong":"The Anthropology and History of the Food You Eat","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":1487,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"06/26/2017","endDt":"08/04/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Online Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.
