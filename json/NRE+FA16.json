Most of the selection and priority of these topics is guided by the interest (and votes) of participants. Recent topics have included: affect in decision making, attention (allocation and focus), coherence/consistency of beliefs, fluency, goals, individual differences, information distortion, memory, methods, neuroscience, non-conscious processes, self-control-regulatory focus-ego depletion, and System 1 versus System 2. Students taking this course for credit are expected (a) to lead the discussions for several of the weekly topics, including the selection of the articles assigned as readings and the development of study questions and (b) to prepare a final paper that is presented in preliminary oral form during one of the last class meetings. The paper can review a body of literature, present a new theory or framework, or report an original experiment (or only a proposal for an experiment). Auditors are only expected to lead several weekly sessions.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Graduate standing.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":368241,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NRE","catalogNbr":"5260","titleShort":"PhD Acct Sem -Valuation","titleLong":"PhD Seminar - Financial Accounting Empirical Research - Topics in Valuation","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17567,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"04:00PM","startDt":"09/13/2016","endDt":"10/04/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":10,"netid":"psm97","firstName":"Partha","middleName":"Sarathy","lastName":"Mohanram"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 135","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH135","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"04:00PM","startDt":"10/18/2016","endDt":"11/15/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 135","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH135","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Non-Johnson Students ONLY:  August 16th at 8:00am to September 6th at 4:00pm.

It consists of three parts. The first part covers arbitrage pricing theory, including the Black Scholes Merton, the Heath Jarrow Morton, and reduced form credit risk models. The second part covers portfolio theory, in both complete and incomplete markets. The third part studies equilibrium pricing models, both complete and incomplete markets, including the notion of market efficiency. This course emphasizes continuous time models and it is based on the use of martingales to understand asset pricing theory. Included in the course is the extensions of the standard theories to include asset price bubbles.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":365474,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NRE","catalogNbr":"5380","titleShort":"PhD Seminar: Macro Org Theory","titleLong":"PhD Seminar: Macro Organization Theory","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18217,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:00AM","timeEnd":"01:00PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"gwd39","firstName":"Glen","middleName":"W.S.","lastName":"Dowell"},{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"cm794","firstName":"Christopher","middleName":"","lastName":"Marquis"},{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"wds4","firstName":"Wesley","middleName":"","lastName":"Sine"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 135","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH135","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"PhD Students ONLY: August 16th at 8:00am to September 6th at 4:00pm.

It is intended for doctoral students who wish to learn the academic field and its current developments. It is also designed to help students learn to use the ideas of the field in research projects of their own design. We will focus on theoretically driven contemporary research, especially that originating in Sociology and appearing in the major journals of Sociology and Management. We will examine the major theoretical perspectives and their current applications. We will also examine some active topical areas. Organization theory has grown to be a massive area, with many applications in related areas. Our focus in the course will be on basic questions about the structure and functioning of organizations: What do organizations look like? How do organizations behave? Why? The main goal of the course is to familiarize you with dominant theoretical perspectives as well as several current research streams and debates; the readings were chosen accordingly.
