In order to expose and combat social injustice, journalists have crossed lines of race, gender, age, class and appearance and gone undercover, sometimes risking their reputations, sanity and even their lives. But what are the results of these experiments? Do the ends justify the sometimes ethically questionable means? How does \"going undercover\" affect an individual or a community? By examining works of John Howard Griffin, Sarah Jones, Morgan Spurlock, Barbara Ehrenreich, Norah Vincent and a variety of identity-probing texts, we examine the complex facets of diverse identities. The course facilitates a range of writing assignments and culminates in students devising and executing their own undercover journalism and research projects.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":368232,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"1131","titleShort":"FWS: Performing the Past","titleLong":"FWS: Performing the Past/Rehearsing the Future","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17952,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"cak269","firstName":"Caitlin","middleName":"Ann","lastName":"Kane"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts 124","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZ124","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-Year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"FWS Session"}],"description":"When artists engage with historical subjects, is there an obligation to represent those subjects accurately? Can dramatic interventions into history empower artists and audiences to imagine a future that diverges from our past? What are the ethical considerations involved in altering historical narratives for political or artistic purposes? Contemporary works like Lin-Manuel Miranda's Hamilton have captured the imagination of American audiences, raising significant questions about theater's ability to not only represent the facts of history, but also its ability (and perhaps responsibility) to meaningfully intervene into historical narratives. This course engages with these questions through the close analysis of dramatic texts. Through in-class discussions, direct instruction, and collaborative writing workshops, students will develop the ability to analyze scholarly arguments and produce coherent, concise, persuasive prose.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":368233,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"1132","titleShort":"FWS:Queer Uncanny Doppelganger","titleLong":"FWS: Boyfriendtwin: Queer Uncanny Doppelgangers","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17960,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jbc276","firstName":"Joshua","middleName":"Bastian","lastName":"Cole"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Judith Eisner Pavillion 201","bldgDescr":"Judith Eisner Pavillion","facilityDescrshort":"ESN201","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-Year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"FWS Session"}],"description":"Why are two identical people unsettling? \"Uncanny\" resemblances suggest the strange, even the supernatural.

As seen, for instance, in the HBO productions of Oz and Orange is the New Black, and events at Abu Ghraib, as well as numerous other recent and historic prison narratives, prisons (and prison metaphors and similes) drive our understanding of crime, our legitimization of U.S. citizenship, and our comprehension of racial and class identities. How can we articulate how prison performs as a social symbol? Drawing on historical and theoretical texts as well as present day media, we will explore how prison as reality and \"prison as metaphor\" permeate our thoughts, our speech, and stage, film, and literary representations.

In contrast, Leonardo DeCaprio's Blood Diamond is a violent look at the role the demand for diamonds has played in destabilizing mineral-rich African countries. But if Hollywood has long been concerned with depicting Africa in particular ways, African filmmakers are at the same time creating their own stories. Popular and scholarly film critics are also contributing to the battle over who speaks for Africa. In this course we will explore these competing images of Africa, questions of imagination versus reality, and the extent to which artists should, if at all, be responsible to the subject of their art.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":353524,"crseOfferNbr":5,"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"2493","titleShort":"Middle Eastern Cinema","titleLong":"Middle Eastern Cinema","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16064,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"das86","firstName":"Deborah","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Starr"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"White Hall 110","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT110","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"2293","type":"C"},{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"2793","type":"C"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"2793","type":"C"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"2193","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Film industries in the Middle East, as in much of the rest of the world, emerged out of efforts at the national level. In the Arab world and Israel, the film industries reflect upon struggles of self-determination. The Iranian film industry underwent significant changes following the Islamic Revolution of 1979. By viewing a range of films from the Arab world, including North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as from Turkey, Israel, and Iran, we will consider the significance of these national rubrics and how they have shaped the work of filmmakers throughout the Middle East.   Films also reach beyond the boundaries of the nation, and so, we will consider how these films transcend national borders. On the one hand we will consider limit factors, like censorship, and the role of language and dialect on film viewership and distribution. And, on the other hand, we will consider the influence of external forces, such as the influence of foreign film markets in Europe and North America on filmmakers in the Middle East, as well as the effects of foreign financing—both from Europe and the Gulf States.  All films will be screened with English subtitles.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":350636,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"2560","titleShort":"American Cinema","titleLong":"American Cinema","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16769,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"08:45PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sh322","firstName":"Sabine","middleName":"","lastName":"Haenni"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall G64-Kau Aud","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSHG64","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Film viewing is required for this class.

We will consider the rise of Hollywood in the age of mass production; the star system; the introduction of sound and the function of the soundtrack; Hollywood's rivalry with television; censorship; the rise of independent film, etc. Weekly screenings introduce major American genres (e.g. science fiction, film noir, the musical) and directors (e.g. Hitchcock, Kubrick,

We read ten plays covering the length of Shakespeare's career: comedies, history plays, tragedies, and romances, including The Merchant of Venice, Twelfth Night, The Tempest, Othello, King Lear, Richard II, Henry IV Part One, and Henry V. Our study will include attention to dramatic forms, Shakespeare's themes, and social and historical contexts, including early modern English theater history. The course combines lectures and hands-on work in weekly discussions focused on performance, close reading, and questions raised by the plays. We will also view some film adaptations of Shakespeare.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":354322,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"2800","titleShort":"Introduction

Students are expected to attend at least one performance outside of class and to collaborate on an in class performance.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"(HTC)","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":354346,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"3800","titleShort":"Acting II","titleLong":"Acting II","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"STU","ssrComponentLong":"Studio","section":"501","classNbr":9495,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"bal5","firstName":"Bruce","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Levitt"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts SB21","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZSB21","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["STU"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Practical exploration of the actor's craft through exercises in physical and psychological action, improvisation and scene study.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"To pre-enroll for this course you will need to see the department registrar in room 223 of the Schwartz Center.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: PMA 2800 and audition.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 14 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"(EP)","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":354330,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"3805","titleShort":"Playwriting I","titleLong":"Playwriting I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17113,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"aas68","firstName":"Aoise","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Stratford"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts 124","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZ124","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"In this introductory class, students will study elements of successful dramatic writing: strong structure, effective dialogue, and imaginative theatricality.
