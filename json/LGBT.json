Students will also engage popcultural texts, such as films, music videos, and novels to address the conjecture of blackness and sexuality in critical and vernacular discourse.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":365308,"crseOfferNbr":5,"subject":"LGBT","catalogNbr":"6945","titleShort":"Body Politics Afr Lit & Cin","titleLong":"Body Politics in African Literature and Cinema","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17253,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"nd326","firstName":"Naminata","middleName":"","lastName":"Diabate"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Rockefeller Hall B16","bldgDescr":"Rockefeller Hall","facilityDescrshort":"RCKB16","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"4995","type":"B"},{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"6945","type":"B"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4945","type":"B"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6945","type":"B"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"4741","type":"B"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4945","type":"B"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"6945","type":"B"},{"subject":"LGBT","catalogNbr":"4945","type":"B"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4945","type":"B"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"6945","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The course examines how postcolonial African writers and filmmakers engage with and revise controversial images of bodies and sexuality-genital cursing, same-sex desire, HIV/AIDS, genital surgeries, etc. Our inquiry also surveys African theorists' troubling of problematic tropes and practices such as the conception in 19th-century racist writings of the colonized as embodiment, the pathologization and hypersexualization of colonized bodies, and the precarious and yet empowering nature of the body and sexuality in the postcolonial African experience. As we focus on African artists and theorists, we also read American and European theorists, including but not certainly limited to Giorgio Agamben, Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, and Joseph Slaughter, detecting the ways in which discourses around bodies in the African context may shape contemporary theories and vice versa.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with ASRC 4995/COML 4945/ENGL 4741/FGSS 4945/LGBT 4945/VISST 4945.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":352755,"crseOfferNbr":5,"subject":"LGBT","catalogNbr":"2760","titleShort":"Desire","titleLong":"Desire","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15540,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"08:45PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"eh36","firstName":"Ellis","middleName":"","lastName":"Hanson"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall G76-Lewis","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSHG76","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"2760","type":"C"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"2760","type":"C"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"2760","type":"C"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"2680","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"\"Language is a skin,\" the critic Roland Barthes once wrote: \"I rub my language against the other.

The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? Does hip hop allow a space for alternative femininities?

One of the goals of this seminar is to think these rulings together instead of treating them as separate entities. How did the struggle for sexual rights and the promotion of color blindness come to coexist so easily within the law?

asylum.  This course examines these issues in historical, political, and social contexts, analyzing U.S. immigration policy and activist responses to this current crisis.  We will work in conjunction with a group of lawyers who represent families held in detention centers in Texas, and will integrate readings from within the fields of transnational feminism, critical legal studies, and immigrant

Throughout the course, we will examine how human rights and social justice activism shape public debates about drugs; we will also meet with local activist groups.

We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and marginalized female hip hop artists contest sexually exploitative images of women. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions?

Today, some of the most heated debates surrounding feminism, identity politics, and Black women are framed within the broad contours of hip hop. This course will explore how women are portrayed in hip hop music and culture, addressing women both as consumers and producers. We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and peripheral female artists use hip hop to affirm their sexual power, articulate Black feminism, and create spaces for their artistic expression. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, performance studies, and queer of color critique to complicate the ways in which women, gender, and sexuality are represented in hip hop music. While our analyses will center on music and on the United States, we will also consider art, fashion, and dance within Black, Latina, and Caribbean interactions with hip hop. The course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about Black women's conceptualizations of feminism? How can we apply early \"hip hop feminism\" to understand current debates about Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? What are the relationships between queer theory and hip hop studies? Does hip hop allow spaces for alternative femininities? How do Black girls use hip hop as a pedagogical tool?

It pays special attention to the ways in which sexuality and gendered embodiment are at present linked to citizenship and other forms of belonging and to how the films draw on Buddhist and Islamic traditions of representation and belief. Focusing on globally circulating Southeast Asian films of the past 15 years, the course draws on current writings from feminism, Buddhist studies, affect theory, queer studies, postcolonial theory, and film studies to ask what new understandings of subjectivity might emerge from these cinemas and their political contexts. Films will be drawn from both mainstream and independent cinema and will include the work of directors such as Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Danny and Oxide Pang, Yau Ching, Thunska Pansittivorakul, Garin Nugroho, and Jean-Jacques Annaud.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":368840,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"LGBT","catalogNbr":"6332","titleShort":"The Velvet Underground Archive","titleLong":"The Velvet Underground Archive","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16185,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jap28","firstName":"Judith","middleName":"Ann","lastName":"Peraino"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Lincoln Hall 316","bldgDescr":"Lincoln Hall","facilityDescrshort":"LNC316","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4331","type":"B"},{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"6331","type":"B"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4333","type":"B"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"6333","type":"B"},{"subject":"LGBT","catalogNbr":"4331","type":"B"},{"subject":"MUSIC","catalogNbr":"4331","type":"B"},{"subject":"MUSIC","catalogNbr":"6331","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The Velvet Underground remains one of the most acclaimed and influential rock groups to emerge within the culturally turbulent era of the late 1960s.
