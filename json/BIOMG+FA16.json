Topics include transmission of genes and chromosomes, sex determination, and chromosomal abnormalities. Students will analyze and discuss problems and case studies using classical pedigree analysis and probability theory. They will acquire sufficient understanding the functions of DNA, RNA and proteins and the technologies for analyzing them to be able to participate in class discussions, concerning the human genome project, genomics, including personal genomics, and ethical implications for human society. The class will meet three times a week with two lecture style presentations and one session devoted to active participatory discussion of emerging social issues related to human genetics and genomics.
