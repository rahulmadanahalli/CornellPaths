It is designed to prepare house staff for the American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia certifying examination. It is suitable for interns and for residents training in other specialties, such as surgery, internal medicine, emergency medicine, critical care, and laboratory animal medicine. Some seminars are useful for graduate students with interests in applied physiology and pharmacology. Speakers are from both inside and outside the College. Topics include the basic sciences as they apply to anesthesiology, such as physics and engineering, applied pharmacology, physiology, and pathology. Clinically-oriented lectures are also given concerning specific anesthetic techniques and species-specific differences.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: VTMED 5606Â or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: third- and fourth-year veterinary students, graduate students, interns, and residents.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"VM"}]
