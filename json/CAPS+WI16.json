It also traces the bilateral relationship between China and Cambodia, paying special attention on the Khmer Rouge era (1975-1979). The course assumes no prior knowledge of China or Cambodia, although it would be a good idea for students to do some reading in advance of the class. We will combine lectures, discussions and field research, culminating with a final exam at the end of the course. Most of the lectures and discussions will take place at Wat Damnak in Siem Reap, with field trips to Angkor, Phnom Penh, Phnom Kulen, Anlong Veng, and Kampong Chhnang.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-ITL)","catalogWhenOffered":"Winter.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"}]
