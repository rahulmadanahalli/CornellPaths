We walk through claimsmaking in an array of federal and state administrative bureaucracies, including wage and hour, health and safety, and discrimination.  We also look at how the immigration enforcement regime intersects with the tenets of at-will employment to grant employers wide latitude in retaliating against undocumented workers and stifling attempts at legal mobilization.  We next assess how these formal protections are filtered through various institutional gatekeepers (including legal advocates and medical experts) and how organizational compliance structures (such as human resources and mediation programs) have limited worker¿s ability to make claims on their rights.  We consider how intersecting bases of inequality (such as gender, race, and national origin) are processed by administrative bureaucracies, and how lay versus legal conceptions of workplace justice often diverge.

Billionaire philanthropists say the same. They and public education's other critics agree that they do not like the educational outcomes produced in our public schools. These increasingly strident forces often blame the political power and the collectively bargained over agreements achieved by the national and local teacher unions  for student failings, high local tax rates, inflated salaries, and monopolistic labor market practices. This narrative and pursuit of policies thereunder are challenging the historic public education configuration in nearly every state.    This course will critically examine these forces and attempt to place their criticisms and suggestions in a policy, political, and legal perspective. Are those who sharply disagree with the current state of the public education system and workplace true reformers? Has our public education system failed, and if so, how do we know? Whether the system has failed or is ailing, what role have unions and their insistence, where allowed, upon exercising their political power and their right to collective bargaining, played in creating this societal tension? And, looking into the future, do we see the educational reformers and/or the unions and their think tank colleagues fashioning a viable set of constructive policies that will attract teachers and make it possible for our youth to learn? Answering these questions will be a challenge, but we will surely attempt to throughout our studies in this course.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":350326,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"4880","titleShort":"Justice","titleLong":"Justice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16831,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"meg3","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"Evan","lastName":"Gold"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 112","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS112","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Graded(GRI)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Examines major theories of justice and applies them to contemporary issues of the student's choice, such as affirmative action and reverse discrimination, income inequality, and gun control.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: junior or senior standing, or permission of instructor.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367612,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"6010","titleShort":"Union Organizing","titleLong":"Union Organizing","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18543,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"klb23","firstName":"Kate","middleName":"L.","lastName":"Bronfenbrenner"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 108","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS108","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Graded(GRI)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"4000","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Examines the theory, practice, and strategy of organizing in a global economy.

Classroom discussions, group exercise and readings will focus on the role of the labor arbitrator in the public and private sectors.\nDuring the first part of the course, topics will include the backgrounds, training, and certifications needed to establish a labor arbitration practice. In addition to focusing on how arbitrators manage hearings, the course will also cover the institutional and administrative arrangements that support the use of labor arbitration. How arbitrators are admitted to rosters and receive appointments from such \"providers\" as the American Arbitration Association, the Federal Mediation &amp; Conciliation Service, the New York State Public Employment Relations Board, the Cornell's ADR Services, etc.) will be examined. The rules used by Cornell and other providers will also be discussed.  The first day will conclude with a labor arbitration exercise and faculty debriefing.\nDuring the next segments of the course, students will examine contemporary practice issues such as discovery, subpoenas, pre-hearing briefs, and problems involving availability of witnesses. Detailed coverage of the standards of contract interpretation, discipline and the role of evidence will be provided.

In the first segment of the course, students will be introduced to the guiding principles of mediation and the concept of conflict. A review of the theories of conflict, its roots and its resolution, set the stage for the role mediation can effectively play in resolving conflict. Students are introduced to the models of mediation and the benefits and challenges of each, including a comparative analysis of evaluative, facilitative and transformative styles of mediation. In the second segment, students will examine the impact of federal and state laws on the process. Significant attention will be devoted to the use of mediation in the public and federal sectors and in public sector negotiation impasses. The course will also explore the use of mediation across industries, including construction, securities, and commercial disputes.  The role of gender, race, culture, ethics and impasse in mediation will all be examined and incorporated into workshops and case studies. Through a series of workshops, students will have several opportunities to apply their knowledge of mediation and begin to develop the skills needed to become effective mediators. Students will be required to submit a final paper to complete the course requirements.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367293,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"6057","titleShort":"Environ Mediat&Negotiation","titleLong":"Environmental Mediation and Negotiation","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16832,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"10:00PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"10/11/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jgb53","firstName":"John","middleName":"G.","lastName":"Bickerman"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 112","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS112","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"The course will build on existing student knowledge of theories of dispute resolution and explore application of these concepts to the field of environmental and natural resource conflicts.

Billionaire philanthropists say the same. They and public education's other critics agree that they do not like the educational outcomes produced in our public schools. These increasingly strident forces often blame the political power and the collectively bargained over agreements achieved by the national and local teacher unions  for student failings, high local tax rates, inflated salaries, and monopolistic labor market practices. This narrative and pursuit of policies thereunder are challenging the historic public education configuration in nearly every state.    This course will critically examine these forces and attempt to place their criticisms and suggestions in a policy, political, and legal perspective. Are those who sharply disagree with the current state of the public education system and workplace true reformers? Has our public education system failed, and if so, how do we know? Whether the system has failed or is ailing, what role have unions and their insistence, where allowed, upon exercising their political power and their right to collective bargaining, played in creating this societal tension? And, looking into the future, do we see the educational reformers and/or the unions and their think tank colleagues fashioning a viable set of constructive policies that will attract teachers and make it possible for our youth to learn? Answering these questions will be a challenge, but we will surely attempt to throughout our studies in this course.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":355579,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"9800","titleShort":"Workshop in LR, Law, and Hist","titleLong":"Workshop in Labor Relations, Law and History","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15602,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:30PM","timeEnd":"06:00PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"jrc32","firstName":"Jefferson","middleName":"R.","lastName":"Cowie"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 381","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS381","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Sat - Unsat Exclusively(SUI)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Provides a forum for the presentation of current research being undertaken by faculty members and graduate students in the Department of Labor Relations, History, and Law, and by invited guests.
