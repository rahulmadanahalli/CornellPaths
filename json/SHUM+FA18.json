Conversely, how do environmentalists come to believe specific actions are necessary to save the world? How can climate justice efforts include local forms of knowledge and expertise? As humans struggle to conceive of new ways to live—and create change—in a time of \"derangement,\" this seminar explores how forms of environmental in/action become authoritative in different social contexts. Here classical and critical theories of authority illuminate how environmental knowledge attains power in some settings but not others; additionally, ethnographies of ecoauthority reveal forms of resiliency that diverge from conventional models of climate remediation. Participants will write short discussion papers, co-lead one class meeting, and submit a final essay.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.

This course explores three relationships between text and human: one of authorship and authority, one of critique and criticism, and one of consumption and reading.

The proposed seminar combines methods derived from the history of the book, literary studies, and cultural and social history in exploring this question. As one might expect, there is no singular answer. Cases will be examined in which authorial evasiveness or reticence undermine the authority of a text while other cases will illustrate how authority has been enhanced by anonymity or anonymous contributions (one thinks, for example, of blind peer review in an academic context). Furthermore, the course will also go beyond the domain of the text by examining authority and anonymity in non-textual contexts.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.

We will examine theoretical critiques of the old political notion that the authority of rulers should be like that of architects: leaders are recognized by their capacity to build interior spaces that nourish human modes of living. We will consider a range of cases in which political projects designed to build all-encompassing interiors have exposed humans and non-humans alike to the possibility of outright destruction. In some cases, authorities are recognized as such due to their perceived capacity to expose themselves and their followers to the possibility of annihilation.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.
