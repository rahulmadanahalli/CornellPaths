Throughout the living world, there are vital processes, such as photosynthesis and vision that are associated with light. Living organisms use the daily and seasonal changes in illumination to regulate their rhythms. However, too much of a good thing is not necessarily a good thing as too much light can result in photodamage. The extraordinary relationship between \"light and life\" provides an important unifying framework for understanding the luminescence of living organisms, the striking and flamboyant coloration of plants and animals as well as the inconspicuous nature of their camouflage in terms of physics, chemistry and biology.

Medical Ethnobotany is the study of medicinal plants used by a group of people. Medicinal plants are either critical constituents of many modem drugs or provide templates for synthetic analogous molecules. In this course we will introduce and be acquainted with past and current plant-based natural remedies used across the globe, exploring their efficacy and mode of actions. We will analyze and compare how plants are employed in the different continents to heal (or alleviate) a plethora of pathological conditions, and consider their roles in different cultures.

Throughout the living world, there are vital processes, such as photosynthesis and vision that are associated with light.

However, too much of a good thing is not necessarily a good thing as too much light can result in photodamage. The extraordinary relationship between \"light and life\" provides an important unifying framework for understanding the luminescence of living organisms, the striking and flamboyant coloration of plants and animals as well as the inconspicuous nature of their camouflage in terms of physics, chemistry and biology.

The class is intended primarily for graduate students, but undergraduates may participate with the permission of the instructor.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: graduate students primarily, with priority given to majors or minors in plant molecular biology.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AG","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":355341,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PLBIO","catalogNbr":"7440","titleShort":"Grad Research in Plant Biology","titleLong":"Graduate Research in Plant Biology","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"201","classNbr":4190,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"jid1","firstName":"Jerrold","middleName":"I.","lastName":"Davis"},{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"jjd5","firstName":"Jeffrey","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Doyle"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Plant Science Building 404","bldgDescr":"Plant Science Building","facilityDescrshort":"PLS404","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Enrollment limited to and required for: second-, third-, and fourth-year graduate students in Plant Biology."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["DIS"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"After the first year, each student presents one seminar per year on his or her thesis research and then meets with the thesis committee members for evaluation.

The class is intended primarily for graduate students, but undergraduates may participate with the permission of the instructor.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: graduate students primarily, with priority given to majors or minors in plant molecular biology.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AG","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":355340,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PLBIO","catalogNbr":"7430","titleShort":"Faculty Research in Plant Cell","titleLong":"Faculty Research in Plant Cell and Molecular Biology","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"RSC","ssrComponentLong":"Research","section":"701","classNbr":4375,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:30PM","timeEnd":"06:00PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"mjs298","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Scanlon"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Enrollment limited to: graduate students or written permission from member of Plant Cell and Molecular Biology Program or from coordinator for undergraduates."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["RSC"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Introduction for graduate students to the research being conducted by Cornell faculty in the Plant Cell and Molecular Biology Program.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AG","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":355341,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PLBIO","catalogNbr":"7440","titleShort":"Grad Research in Plant Biology","titleLong":"Graduate Research in Plant Biology","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"201","classNbr":1246,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"jid1","firstName":"Jerrold","middleName":"I.","lastName":"Davis"},{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"jjd5","firstName":"Jeffrey","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Doyle"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Enrollment limited to and required for: second-, third-, and fourth-year graduate students in Plant Biology."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["DIS"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"After the first year, each student presents one seminar per year on his or her thesis research and then meets with the thesis committee members for evaluation.
