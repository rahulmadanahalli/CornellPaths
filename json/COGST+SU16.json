Instead, an objective, deliberated, and multidisciplinary approach is necessary.  To that end, cognitive science draws on, and integrates, at least five disciplines: Psychology, Neuroscience, Computer Science, Linguistics, and Philosophy.  This course provides an introduction to the insights that these disciplines offer cognitive science while introducing students to current understanding of attention, memory, visual perception, learning, problem solving, language comprehension, and consciousness. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(KCM-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"A 1 credit Writing in the Majors sections is available, COGST 1104.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2629,"crseId":351496,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"COGST","catalogNbr":"1111","titleShort":"Making a Difference by Design","titleLong":"Making a Difference by Design","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1366,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:30AM","timeEnd":"12:45PM","startDt":"06/27/2016","endDt":"08/05/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"sc2259","firstName":"Sung Eun","middleName":"","lastName":"Chung"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 108","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS108","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"06/27/2016","endDt":"08/05/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"DEA","catalogNbr":"1110","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"6WK","sessionBeginDt":"06/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"08/05/2016","sessionLong":"Six Week Summer"}],"description":"This course focuses on how leaders in a variety of fields use design as a social change agent.  It interweaves theories of leadership and creative problem-solving through case study examinations of a wide range of design innovations in communication, business, education, medicine, human development, history and ecology.
