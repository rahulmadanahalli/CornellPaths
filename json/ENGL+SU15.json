The most important texts for the course are the essays of students enrolled in it; but we also read and discuss personal memoirs.

The course explores classic and contemporary science fiction from Frankenstein to The Hunger Games alongside a rich array of fiction, films, and new media from Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
