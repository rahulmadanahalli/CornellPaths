This \"American exceptionalism\" -- the turn to mass incarceration -- has been fostered by the use of sharply-delineated categories that define vast numbers of people as outlaws and others as law-abiding. These categories that are based on ideas of personal responsibility and assumptions about race are modified somewhat by a liberal commitment to human rights.   Our purpose in this course is to understand how such ideas have taken root and to locate the consequences of these ideas for policy and practice. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring, winter, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2615,"crseId":366670,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"3434","titleShort":"Chinese Empire & Cambodian Exp","titleLong":"Chinese Empire and the Cambodian Experience","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1049,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"06:00PM","startDt":"01/01/2016","endDt":"01/17/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"am847","firstName":"Andrew","middleName":"","lastName":"Mertha"}],"pattern":"MTWRFSSu","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in Siem Reap, Cambodia.

It also traces the bilateral relationship between China and Cambodia, paying special attention on the Khmer Rouge era (1975-1979). The course assumes no prior knowledge of China or Cambodia, although it would be a good idea for students to do some reading in advance of the class. We will combine lectures, discussions and field research, culminating with a final exam at the end of the course. Most of the lectures and discussions will take place at Wat Damnak in Siem Reap, with field trips to Angkor, Phnom Penh, Phnom Kulen, Anlong Veng, and Kampong Chhnang.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-ITL)","catalogWhenOffered":"Winter.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2615,"crseId":366435,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"6021","titleShort":"Poverty & Social Policy","titleLong":"Poverty & Social Policy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"100","classNbr":1024,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:00AM","timeEnd":"12:00PM","startDt":"01/04/2016","endDt":"01/23/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"jm2362","firstName":"Jamila","middleName":"","lastName":"Michener"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"White Hall B06","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHTB06","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"01:45PM","timeEnd":"03:00PM","startDt":"01/04/2016","endDt":"01/23/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"White Hall B06","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHTB06","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Winter Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

This course explores the causes of poverty in the United States and analyzes the various policy strategies meant to address it. The first part of the course will assess the economic, social, and cultural theories that scholars have offered as explanations of persistent poverty while the second segment will examine specific policies related to welfare, labor markets, urban neighborhoods, family structure and the criminal justice system. Through all this, we will foreground the consequences of policy for the well-being of the poor and the role that the poor themselves play in shaping and responding to policy environments.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"}]
