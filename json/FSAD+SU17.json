We will explore various media and techniques used in apparel design and develop design images with the ultimate goal of creating a professional-grade portfolio based on one's individual design aesthetic. Students will be introduced to techniques in the design process and presentation, as well as conventional graphic and digital tools such as Adobe Photoshop. Students will also be exposed to a variety of resources, including Cornell's Costume and Textile Collection, and cutting-edge technology, including 3-D Body Scanning, and innovative functional apparel. Studio sessions comprise lecture, discussion, design charettes, and group critiques. There are no prerequisites for this course; no sewing experience required.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"The instructor will provide a list of supplies, which will cost approximately $50.
