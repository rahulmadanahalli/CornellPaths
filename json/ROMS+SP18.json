in New York, passing through Munich, Vienna, Milan, and Buenos Aires, Bohemianism expressed an aesthetic and political revolt against the capitalist ethics of work, sexual conformism, repressive order, and the conventions of academic art.  Its representatives were young people whose precarious life took place in the margins of these great cities.  Artists, writers, and political conspirators were the heroes of this fragmented and highly unstable avant-garde.  This course will retrace the main steps of Bohemianism, from Murger and Courbet to Dada and surrealism, from The Masses to the Beatniks and the Punk movement of the 1970s.  Karl Marx,  André Breton, Walter Benjamin, John Reed, Claude Cahun, Hannah Arendt, Allen Ginsberg and other thinkers will help us to explore this vast

discrepancies between the analytical approaches focused on the perpetrators and those focused on the victims, the inscription of the Holocaust into the broader context of war violence, and its comparison with the genocidal violence of colonialism.  Finally, it will investigate some methodological problems concerning the place of testimony in history writing and the permanent connections, both fruitful and problematic, between history and memory.  This means taking into account the entanglement of the most productive areas of Holocaust scholarship (Germany, France and the United States) as well as the relationship between the historiography of the Holocaust and other disciplines (memory studies, postcolonial studies,

performance, conceptual, and cinematic practices that corrupt the spreadsheet and the exposé; that reflect their makers' commitments to portraying extreme labor situations in a period of greater Mexican neoliberal transition now synonymous with NAFTA, culture and drug wars, and border militarization and maquilization. Assigned texts will include artwork by the Border Art Workshop and Elizabeth Sisco, Louis Hock, and David Avalos; writing by Gloria Anzaldúa, Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Sara Uribe, and Sergio González Rodríguez; contributions to the Tijuana-San Diego installation festival inSITE; and \"undocumentaries\" like Alex Rivera's Borders Trilogy, Sergio De La Torre and Vicki Funari's Maquilapolis, and Natalia Almada's El Velador.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.
