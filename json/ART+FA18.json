composite image generated through various lens-based practices and equipment such as still and video camera, scanner, internet, etc. It is an intensive experimental studio integrating digital strategies of negative production to create images produced with traditional light-sensitive materials. Alternative photographic methods are approached as a printmaking process. Students are encouraged to work outside the camera and beyond the negative edge. The history of photographic print materials from the photogenic drawing of Talbot to the contemporary gelatin silver print will be introduced. Images will be produced using cyanotype, Vandyke brown, gum bichromate, and palladium emulsions.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AAP, LA-AAP)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: ART 2601 or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AR"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":354309,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ART","catalogNbr":"3799","titleShort":"Digital Media: Special Topics","titleLong":"Digital Media: Special Topics","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"STU","ssrComponentLong":"Studio","section":"501","classNbr":16261,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rtf9","firstName":"Renate","middleName":"Terese","lastName":"Ferro"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sibley Hall 223","bldgDescr":"Sibley Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SBL223","meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Tactical Media for Surviving Life"}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["STU"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2018","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Topics TBA.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AAP, LA-AAP)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: ART 2701 or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AR"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":364539,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ART","catalogNbr":"3803","titleShort":"Art History: Italian Cinema","titleLong":"Art History: Italian Cinema","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"021","classNbr":5283,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"03:30PM","timeEnd":"07:30PM","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":11,"netid":"cc863","firstName":"Carolina","middleName":"","lastName":"Ciampaglia"},{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"am2747","firstName":"Annalisa","middleName":"","lastName":"Maione"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in Rome."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ROME","locationDescr":"Rome, Italy","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARCH","catalogNbr":"3117","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2018","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course examines the cinematic representation of Italy with particular emphasis to the use of settings and space.
