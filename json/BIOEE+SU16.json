This course examines evolution as a science and places it in an historical context.  Lectures focus on descent with modification, the nature of natural  selection, the history of the earth, the information content of the fossil record, and processes responsible for diversification (speciation and extinction).  The science of evolutionary biology is presented in the context of a broader history of ideas in science.  The course also explores the importance of evolutionary thinking in the 21st century, including discussion of antibiotic and pesticide resistance, personalized genomics, climate change, and the conflict between creationists and evolutionists.
