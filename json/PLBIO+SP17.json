Medical Ethnobotany is the study of medicinal plants used by a group of people. Medicinal plants are either critical constituents of many modem drugs or provide templates for synthetic analogous molecules. In this course we will introduce and be acquainted with past and current plant-based natural remedies used across the globe, exploring their efficacy and mode of actions. We will analyze and compare how plants are employed in the different continents to heal (or alleviate) a plethora of pathological conditions, and consider their roles in different cultures. The course is designed for students with an interest in the natural world and in traditional medicine.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Describe the value of plants for human health both verbally and in written form.","Identify and define the most commonly used medicinal plants across the continents.","Describe how medicinal plants are used in various cultures, how efficacy is measured, and explain in general terms the modes of action of selected medicinal plants."],"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":366133,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PLBIO","catalogNbr":"1130","titleShort":"Light and Life","titleLong":"Light and Life: The Relationship between Light and Life in the Natural World","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":5099,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"row1","firstName":"Randy","middleName":"O.","lastName":"Wayne"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Plant Science Building 114","bldgDescr":"Plant Science Building","facilityDescrshort":"PLS114","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"By most accounts, whether theological or scientific, light is fundamental for life.

The extraordinary relationship between \"light and life\" provides an important unifying framework for understanding the luminescence of living organisms, the striking and flamboyant coloration of plants and animals as well as the inconspicuous nature of their camouflage in terms of physics, chemistry and biology.

Society is facing growing challenges associated with feeding the rapidly expanding global population, while dealing with factors that limit food production, such as climate instability and loss of agricultural land. We will discuss those challenges and identify issues that will limit future food security.
