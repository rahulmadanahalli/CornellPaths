The question of \"how we see\" is discussed in terms of (1) procedures of sight (from optical machines to the psychology of vision and the philosophy of aesthetics); (2) spaces of vision (from landscapes to maps to cities); (3) objects of vision (from sacred sites to illuminated books to digital art); and (4) performances of vision (race, sexualities, ethnicities, cultures). Of importance to the course is the practical and conceptual relation of 20th-century visual technologies (photography, cinema, video, and computing) to their historical corollaries in the arts. The course draws on the visual traditions of both Western and non-Western societies and study texts that have defined the premises and analytic vocabularies of the visual. Through viewings, screenings, collaborative writing, and art projects, students develop the critical skills necessary to appreciate how the approaches that define visual studies complicate traditional models of defining and analyzing art objects. Guest lecturers occasionally address the class.

It introduces dance-based critical thinking, critical viewing, and research writing through written texts, recorded music and embodied performances mostly located in North America. Canonical and emergent dance research texts serve as principle lenses through which seminar discussions, presentations, and workshops, and writing will emerge. This specialized course takes students through a broad yet interconnected range of themes including racial formation and choreography theory, whiteness, Black dancing bodies, Latinidad, choreographing Asian America, and indigenous dance. Throughout the course students engage in interdisciplinary discussions on the racialized body, close readings of dance texts, and analyses of performances. Students will then be challenged to demonstrate their own original analyses through in-class activities, discussion, and a research paper.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366650,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4605","titleShort":"Art/Science Intersections","titleLong":"Art/Science Intersections: More than Meets the Eye","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15985,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"crj2","firstName":"Charles","middleName":"R.","lastName":"Johnson"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lp286","firstName":"Lisa","middleName":"","lastName":"Pincus"},{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"aw27","firstName":"Andrew","middleName":"","lastName":"Weislogel"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Johnson Museum Of Art 2L34","bldgDescr":"Johnson Museum Of Art","facilityDescrshort":"JMA2L34","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"4605","type":"B"},{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"6605","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This interdisciplinary seminar capitalizes on the extraordinary loan of seventeenth-century Dutch paintings from a private collection to the Johnson Museum, and an ongoing Mellon Foundation initiative to study them and other objects from the Museum's collection, using both art-historical and scientific, data-driven modes of investigation. Both methods are invested in material culture: the communicative visible surface of the artwork and its underlying materials-support, ground, pigment. Within the context of early modern painting and works on paper, and drawing on Cornell's exceptional resources and key experts, we will employ various technical methods, including thread counting of historic canvases, pattern matching in historic papers, and microscopic pigment analysis, and will look for hidden images in paintings through x-ray fluorescence mapping at Cornell's synchrotron facility (CHESS).","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with ARTH 6605.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":357731,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4761","titleShort":"Art & Social Histories","titleLong":"Art and Social Histories","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":7858,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"llm4","firstName":"Laura","middleName":"Lee","lastName":"Meixner"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 144","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH144","meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Mass Culture & the Great Depression"}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Graded(GRI)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4306","type":"B"},{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"4761","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Topic for spring 2015: Mass Culture in the Great Depression.\nThis seminar explores public art and popular entertainments as the means for everyday people to politically engage or escape the Great Depression (1929-41).  Discussions include Living Newspapers, the Federal Theater Project, WPA printmakers, FSA photographers (Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Gordon Parks, Arthur Rothstein), and Social Realist painters (Reginald Marsh, Ben Shahn). Connecting these is FDR's New Deal, its controversial government support for the arts, and censorship.  We consider dance as political theater, big bands and swing, \"screwball\" comedies, Busby Berkeley \"gold diggers\" musicals, and Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers spectaculars.  We begin with the importance of early radio in the home and how it constructed gender and race through soap operas and serial thrillers, especially the Green Hornet and the Shadow.  Students will draw on the digitized American Memory Project, Ken Burns' documentary The Dustbowl, and the Johnson Art Museum print and photography collections.  Films include Gold Diggers of 1933, Stella Dallas, Sullivan's Travels, and Woody Allen's Radio Days.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Auditing not permitted.

While the symbolic significance of such clothing has long been recognized, the activity of producing fabric itself deserves more attention. By this we do not only mean the various techniques and technological devices involved in spinning, weaving, stitching, or sewing, but also the analogical activities and metaphors they entailed. What stories did they tell? How did their connection to writing, remembering, lovemaking, or ruling one's kingdom, to name but a few examples, play out metaphorically in cloth? And how did fabrics depend on or transform the transmission of techniques, fashions and motives, but also gender, concepts of the body or the built environment?","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with ARTH 6856.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366519,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4956","titleShort":"Pygmalion: Aesthetics of Touch","titleLong":"Pygmalion: Aesthetics of Touch","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17028,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"vjp33","firstName":"Verity","middleName":"Jane","lastName":"Platt"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"A D White House 201","bldgDescr":"A D White House","facilityDescrshort":"ADW201","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"4956","type":"C"},{"subject":"CLASS","catalogNbr":"4602","type":"C"},{"subject":"SHUM","catalogNbr":"4997","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"\"Please Do Not Touch\" is one of the signs we are most accustomed to seeing in art museums, yet the very need to make this request demonstrates how objects often invite, seek, even demand that we transgress the limits of vision and engage with them physically. In the Pygmalion myth, the artist's creating hand and the viewer's desire to touch come together in a fantasy of union with the object that has been endlessly appropriated and reimagined in later Western culture. Focusing on Classical art, this course explores the role of touch and embodiment in the viewing and reception of art objects, drawing on ancient models of sense-perception as well as 20th Century theorists such as Reigl, Berenson and Merleau-Ponty.  ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":355388,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"6174","titleShort":"Introduction To Film Analysis","titleLong":"Introduction to Film Analysis: Meaning and Value","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":8711,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:35PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"crw225","firstName":"Chelsea","middleName":"R.","lastName":"Wessels"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts B21","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZB21","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"2540","type":"B"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"6540","type":"B"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"2174","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Intensive consideration of the ways films generate meaning and of the ways we attribute meaning and value to films.
