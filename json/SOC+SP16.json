of society (e.g., population, the economy) and the sweeping changes that have occurred within them over the past couple of centuries.  Particular attention will be paid to changes in social cohesion, the division of labor, the spatial organization of society, and technology. These theories, which are covered in the first two segments of the course, provide some insight into where society is going and what challenges have emerged along the way.  In the third segment of the course, we will look more closely at the role of individuals and everyday interaction in the genesis of social phenomena.  We will explore theories about what motivates individuals' social behavior, the role of rationality and emotion, how the micromechanics of interpersonal contact can shape larger society, and the subtle links between biological and social processes.  In the final segment of the course, we will explore complex webs that emerge through social actors' connections to each other, and how these network structures have been shaped by the various processes that were examined during the semester.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"Forbidden Overlap: Students may not receive credit for both SOC 1101 and DSOC 1101.","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":367980,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"1900","titleShort":"Discussions of Justice","titleLong":"Discussions of Justice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18739,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"08:30PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"apd48","firstName":"Austin","middleName":"Paul","lastName":"Duggan"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rwm5","firstName":"Richard","middleName":"William","lastName":"Miller"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Carl Becker House G32","bldgDescr":"Carl Becker House","facilityDescrshort":"BKRG32","meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This semester's theme will be inequalities in the United States, political, economic, racial, social and educational.

How do people find jobs? Does culture matter for economic action? What exactly is a market? Why is there a concentration of high-tech firms in Silicon Valley? Why has entrepreneurial capitalism emerged in China? These are some of the questions that this course will explore through the theoretical lens of economic sociology. Economic sociology has sought to understand the beliefs, norms, and institutions that shape and drive the global economy. It has sought to extend the sociological approach to the study of economic life by studying the interactions between social structure and economic action. The systematic application of sociological reasoning to explain economic action involves analysis of the ways in which social networks, norms, and institutions matter in economic transactions. The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to economic sociology as an approach and research program to understand and explain the relationship between economy and society in the modern era.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":354697,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"2206","titleShort":"International Development","titleLong":"International Development","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":5270,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:00AM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":6,"netid":"pdm1","firstName":"Philip","middleName":"David","lastName":"McMichael"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Warren Hall 151","bldgDescr":"Warren Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WRN151","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Juniors and Seniors may choose to take course for 1 additional credit if selected from applicant pool during first week of class.

This course considers development as an evolving world project and from the perspective of its social and ecological impact: asking questions about costs and benefits of economic growth, about the global context (geo-political, institutional, production, consumption, and discursive relations), and the sustainability of various models. We relate development trends in the South/Third World with those in the North/First World. We also examine shared, global issues, such as the environment, human rights, security, and their condition in different parts of the world. In examining development historically, we encourage students to situate trends shaping the twenty-first century world, and how they can contribute, as global citizens, to the ongoing debate about how to reformulate development as an inclusive an empowering social process.\nThis course combines Lectures with discussion, and uses films and section discussions to promote reflection on diversity of cultures and understandings of human development. It also includes a special component (access by instructor permission), in conjunction with Cornell's Writing in the Majors Program. This is worth an additional credit hour, and is for advanced students. These students will meet additionally in weekly Sections with a Writing Instructor from Development Sociology for a special topic focus to enhance understanding of course material as well as writing skills.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-SBY)","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Discuss the history of development.","Situate trends shaping the twenty-first century world, and how they can contribute, as global citizens, to the ongoing debate about how to reformulate development as an inclusive an empowering social process."],"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":354653,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"2208","titleShort":"Social Inequality","titleLong":"Social Inequality","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":8878,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sa792","firstName":"Steven","middleName":"Elias","lastName":"Alvarado"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Kennedy Hall 116-Call Aud","bldgDescr":"Kennedy Hall","facilityDescrshort":"KND116","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"DSOC","catalogNbr":"2090","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course reviews contemporary approaches to understanding social inequality and the processes by which it comes to be seen as legitimate, natural, or desirable.  We address questions of the following kind:  What are the major forms of stratification in human history?  Are inequality and poverty inevitable?  How many social classes are there in advanced industrialism societies?  Is there a \"ruling class?\"  Are lifestyles, attitudes, and personalities shaped fundamentally by class membership?  Can individuals born into poverty readily escape their class origins and move upward in the class structure?  Are social contacts and \"luck\" important forces in matching individuals to jobs and class positions?  What types of social processes serve to maintain and alter racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination in labor markets?  Is there an \"underclass?\"  These and other questions are addressed in light of classical and contemporary theory and research.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":362489,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"2250","titleShort":"Schooling & Society","titleLong":"Schooling and Society","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16901,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"hjh55","firstName":"Hilary","middleName":"Jane","lastName":"Holbrow"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall G88","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URHG88","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The primary goal of this course is to understand the relationship between education and society, with an emphasis on exploring educational inequality.

We will examine the rise of medical sociology as a discipline, the professionalization of medicine, and processes of medicalization and demedicalization. We will look at alternative medical practices and how they differ from and converge with the dominant medical paradigm.

There are two main components of this course. First, we'll read and discuss previous research on the health effects of social status, patient-physician interactions, employment/work, stress, social networks, social support, loneliness, culture and religion, and the neighborhood context. We'll consider both qualitative and quantitative research on social life and health, with an eye toward identifying the strengths and weaknesses of various methodological approaches and gaps in current knowledge. The second component of this course is focused on the development of your own research regarding the relationship between social context and health. You'll explore this using data from a population-based social survey. Class instruction for this portion of the course will cover research question development, the statistical analysis of survey data, and social scientific writing. Three research reports written during the semester will provide you with a foundation from which you will write and present a final paper that considers how health is shaped by the social world.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":354704,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"3240","titleShort":"Environment, Society, and Land","titleLong":"Environment, Society, and Land","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":7668,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"sh104","firstName":"Sarah","middleName":"Carissa","lastName":"Giroux"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Warren Hall B50","bldgDescr":"Warren Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WRNB50","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"DSOC","catalogNbr":"3240","type":"C"},{"subject":"STS","catalogNbr":"3241","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The course examines the relationships between human populations and the environment, with an emphasis on the importance of demographic change in shaping the natural environment.

Focus on population will expand beyond traditional emphasis on population size to also consider the role that population composition and other population processes play in driving environmental change (including climate, land-use, water, energy resources), and how this change, in turn, impacts human populations. We will also raise some of the methodological challenges that arise when studying these linkages, and students will work with secondary data to conduct their own analyses on population-environment questions.

Finally, we will explore extensions of the linear regression model, including models for categorical outcomes and hierarchical linear modeling. While statistical modeling is the focus of the course, we proceed with the assumption that models are only as good as the theoretical and substantive knowledge behind them. Thus, in covering the technical material, we will spend considerable time discussing the link between substantive knowledge and statistical practice.

These populations are difficult to sample using standard survey research methods because they lack a sampling frame, that is, an exhaustive list of population members from which the sample can be drawn and constructing a sampling frame is not feasible due to the closed nature of the populations networks or associated factors. Populations with these characteristics are important to studies of public health (e.g., drug users and commercial sex workers), public policy (e.g., immigrants and the homeless), and arts and culture (e.g., jazz musicians and aging artists). This course will survey the use of network-based approaches to sample populations and study the structure of social networks. The focus will range from initial work on biased network theory, through various approaches based on snowball sampling, the \"random-walk\" approach, adaptive sampling, and link-tracing designs, to a principal focus on respondent-driven sampling (RDS), including the analytics underlying that method, operational procedures, recent work extending the method, the potential for use of RDS to study the structure of very large social networks, and open areas in which further work is continuing and alternative formulations are emerging.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":358029,"crseOfferNbr":4,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"6430","titleShort":"Topics Social & Political Phil","titleLong":"Topics in Social and Political Philosophy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16689,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"rwm5","firstName":"Richard","middleName":"William","lastName":"Miller"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Stimson Hall 206","bldgDescr":"Stimson Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STM206","meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Inequalities: Economic, Political, Social,& Racial"}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4655","type":"B"},{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"6656","type":"B"},{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"4655","type":"B"},{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"6656","type":"B"},{"subject":"PHIL","catalogNbr":"4470","type":"B"},{"subject":"PHIL","catalogNbr":"6430","type":"B"},{"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"4430","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Advanced discussion of a topic in social and political philosophy.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":354729,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"6910","titleShort":"Independent Study","titleLong":"Independent Study","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":6214,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"For graduates who wish to obtain research experience or to do extensive reading on a special topic.
