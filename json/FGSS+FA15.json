disrupting her life, through analysis of dreams, symptoms, bungled actions, slips of the tongue, and repetitive behaviors.  Freud finds that these apparently irrational acts and behavior are ordered by the logic of the fantasy, which provides a mental representation of a taumatic childhood experience and the effects it unleashes in the mind and body-effects he called drives.  As \"unbound\" energies, the drives give rise to symptoms, repetitive acts, and fantasmatic stagings that menace our health and sometimes threaten social coexistence, but that also rise to the desires, creative acts, and social projects we identify as the essence of human life.  Readings will include fundamental texts on the unconscious, repression, fantasy, and the death drive, as well as case studies and speculative essays on mythology, art, religion, and group psychology.  Students will be asked to keep a dream journal and to work on their unconscious formations, and will have the chance to produce creative projects as well as analytic

Although issues of gender and sexuality have always been integral to human rights, in the last 40 years, they have become an increasingly articulated component of human rights activism, law, and policy making. This gendering of the international human rights agenda has run parallel to the growing institutionalization of feminist, gender, and sexuality studies in the academy. We explore this convergence between human rights theory and its practice in order to think about how feminist scholarship both emerges from and informs everyday lives around the world, especially those of women and sexual minorities. Within this rather broad rubric, we will consider various case studies and use these as examples for student research papers; these case studies will focus on central figures in human rights discourse—children, sex workers, garment workers, migrant agricultural labor, and transnational athletes. Throughout the semester, we will also consider how this course and others in FGSS prepare one to pursue jobs in human rights organizations and other advocacy fields.  This senior seminar is only open to, and is required by, Feminist, Gender, &amp; Sexuality Studies majors.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies majors.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367677,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4121","titleShort":"Korea Through Gender","titleLong":"Studying Korea Through Gender and Sexuality","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18789,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":10,"netid":"ek638","firstName":"Eun-Shil","middleName":"","lastName":"Kim"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Stimson Hall G01","bldgDescr":"Stimson Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STMG01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"4021","type":"C"},{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"4421","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The course explores contemporary Korean society and culture through the issues of gender and sexuality. In the 1980s the notion of gender and sexuality began to use to problematize women's position and gender relations in Korea by the groups of women's movement and the community of women's studies. Nowadays the discourse of gender and sexuality is one of the most controversial public discourse as well as personal politics in Korean society. The issues of gender and sexuality, which include conflicts, differences and contestation of Korean people depending on generation, class, sexual identity, etc. reflect changes and complexity of Korean society. Under neoliberal regime, these issues are also framed by economy. Thus, Korea newspapers report the emergence of the generation who gives up dating, marriage and childbirth because they cannot find jobs while at the same time young people's desire and idea for romantic love is getting strengthened in relation to consumption culture. By examining diverse readings and visual materials, this course aims to understand how the issues of gender and sexuality is working as one of organizing powers of Korean society in relation to family, state, globalization, colonial/postcolonialism, popular cultures and etc.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367328,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4153","titleShort":"Topics in Feminist Media Arts","titleLong":"Topics in Feminist Media Arts","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17296,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"09:25PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mf252","firstName":"Maria","middleName":"","lastName":"Fernandez"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 144","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH144","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"4153","type":"B"},{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"6153","type":"B"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"6153","type":"B"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4153","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Seminar topics rotate each semester.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":359790,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4231","titleShort":"Gender and Technology","titleLong":"Gender and Technology in Historical Perspectives","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17203,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sbp65","firstName":"Sara","middleName":"B.","lastName":"Pritchard"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Rockefeller Hall 183","bldgDescr":"Rockefeller Hall","facilityDescrshort":"RCK183","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"4231","type":"C"},{"subject":"STS","catalogNbr":"4231","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Why are some technologies such as cars and computers associated with men and masculinity?

We will bring some concreteness to this wide-ranging field by considering theory in relation to particular situations; for example, we might look at \"desire\" in relation to pornography and media studies, or \"transnationalism\" in relation to the murders of women along the U.S.-Mexico border.
