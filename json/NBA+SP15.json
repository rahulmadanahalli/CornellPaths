Taxes have a direct impact on cash flow and often divert 30 to 40 percent of the firm's pretax cash flow to the government, effectively making the government the single largest stakeholder in many firms. Having an understanding of taxation and how firms plan accordingly is important for just about any career path students choose, whether they will be an investment banker, venture capitalist, consultant, money manager, CFO, treasurer, controller, taking over a family-owned business, or an entrepreneur setting up a new business.

The attitudes, values, and practices that prevail in their organizations induce otherwise ethical employees to take actions that violate widely shared norms of conduct. Such behavior can be costly-even disastrous-leading to ruined careers, tarnished corporate reputations, and legal liability for the individuals and their companies. In an environment where \"only results matter,\" it can be difficult for a new MBA or law school graduate to recognize the risks. If she does see the dangers, she may still find it hard to avoid them.  This course seeks to help MBAs and law students understand how a firm's culture, combined with common human tendencies, can tempt-or push-employees into unethical behavior. It also considers how employees can meet ethical challenges posed by their firms' cultures. Class sessions include discussion of case studies and readings reporting on relevant research in psychology and organizational behavior, as well as talks by noted guest speakers from the worlds of business, law, journalism, and academia. The grade in the course is based on class participation and on two written case analyses, including a final project.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":361612,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5150","titleShort":"Leadership Theory & Practice","titleLong":"Leadership Theory and Practice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12950,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mjh35","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Hostetler"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B10","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB10","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"05:45PM","timeEnd":"08:25PM","startDt":"03/16/2015","endDt":"03/16/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mjh35","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Hostetler"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***NON-JOHNSON GRAD and UG SENIORS ONLY***\r\n** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\r\nDeadline for Changing Grade Option: March 13th, 2015.\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Non-Johnson Students ONLY:  January 13th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.

It will examine various new developments in retailing and the application of operations management principles to these developments. It is recommended for students interested in careers in (1) Retailing and supply chain management, (2) Businesses like banking, consulting, and information technology that provide services to retailers, and (3) Manufacturing companies that sell their products through retailers. Retailing is not only a link in the supply chain, but also an important industry for a number of reasons. This industry, more than any other, is at the forefront of business changes since it directly connects with the consumer and generates demand for the rest of the economy. It is an intensely dynamic industry, with continuous changes in marketing channels, technology, and sourcing. It has gone through remarkable developments through history, and has often been an incubator for new business concepts. Currently, retailing is leading economic growth and transformation in emerging markets around the world, both through global sourcing and global marketing. In the US, retailing comprises 40% of the economy, and is the largest employer. Problems faced by retailers are shared by other firms in the economy, and retailers are often the dominant player in a supply chain. Thus, retailing is also academically interesting as a laboratory to learn and test concepts that may apply to other businesses. Various types of sophisticated data can be collected in retailing easier than in other industries. Performance can be measured accurately and rapidly. Managers in retailing can also change their strategies and product mix in relatively short periods of time. Finally, low entry and exit barriers magnify risks and rewards in this industry, so that we find firms with stellar growth as well those with a history of bankruptcies. We shall study all these different aspects of retail operations through case discussions and lectures.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":350106,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5240","titleShort":"Macroeconomics & Int'l Trade","titleLong":"Macroeconomics and International Trade","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13111,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"oh33","firstName":"Ori","middleName":"","lastName":"Heffetz"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B05","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB05","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"GM , Grad and UG Srs ONLY\r\nNon-Johnson students may add themselves to the waitlists during their enrollment periods, however Johnson Students have priority into the classes and non-Johnsons will be enrolled: 1) IF seats are still available after Johnson students complete\r\ntheir enrollment period and 2) IF the instructor allows.\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 13th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.  \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  January 29th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.  \r\nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 4th with permission of the faculty.

At the beginning of the simulation, each team develops a strategy, and before the results of the last decision have been determined, presents an analysis of its performance, lessons learned, and its strategy for the future in a \"board of directors\" meeting. The first course meeting is 4 hours to introduce the simulation and its mechanics as well as a discussion of company strategy. Future meetings are weekly for 2 hours which includes time for teams to review their performance and work on their company decisions. Grades are based on the value created for the company's shareholders (relative to other firms in the same industry), the team's strategy, and the instructor's evaluation of team's performance at the board meeting.

The goal of the written work is to simulate the process in which business people, investment bankers, and lawyers work together to structure transactions across national borders. The reading covers the basic business and legal issues most frequently encountered in international mergers and acquisitions. Class discussion occasionally refers to the reading but generally covers other issues.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":364992,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5880","titleShort":"Critical Thinking for Bus.

The first few class sessions look at a series of brief articles that attempt to advance arguments in favor of a particular business proposition, and students learn how to examine these arguments critically, including by evaluating the strength and limitations of the evidence presented and by identifying and articulating the best counter-arguments to the positions offered. The remainder of the course is spent applying these critical thinking skills to a set of business cases, using a Strategic Thinking Problem-Solving framework. By the end of the course, the goal is for students to be able to approach business problems in a systematic and critically thoughtful way, and to produce and communicate a problem solution that is well reasoned, well received by ultimate decision makers, and likely to be implemented with success by a group/organization that a student is leading.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":362024,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5920","titleShort":"Experience in Int'l Management","titleLong":"Experience in International Management","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"FLD","ssrComponentLong":"Field Studies","section":"001","classNbr":12962,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":9,"netid":"rjc89","firstName":"Richard","middleName":"Joseph","lastName":"Coyle"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":"South Africa"}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Trip Dates: 1/5/15 thru 1/18/15"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"South Africa"}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["FLD"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Sat -

Sessions will examine the constraints to entrepreneurs and the ways in which they obtain financing with a particular focus on venture capital and emerging markets. The course will use cases of successful entrepreneurs under the most difficult circumstances and will address entrepreneurship in a serious downturn and networking across borders. In addition to common issues related to starting a business and investing in it, the class will address issues not normally on the radar screen of U.S. entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. The course will draw on the experience of investors and entrepreneurs, cases prepared especially for this course, as well as findings reported in the research literature. This course is meant to be in part a practical guide to students who wish to be entrepreneurs outside the United States or to create cross-border businesses. It may be of interest to people working in entrepreneurial environments in other organizations or students who want to get involved in various forms of financing entrepreneurial ventures. Students may use the course to explore development of a business concept or plan outside (at least in part) the United States. There will be a particular concentration on Asia, the role of government in stimulating entrepreneurship and venture capital and the nitty-gritty issues of valuing young and private firms sharing profits, raising resources, and organizing and managing human resources.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: At least one finance or economics class.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":350427,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6010","titleShort":"Electronic Commerce","titleLong":"Electronic Commerce","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12964,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lvo2","firstName":"Levent","middleName":"V.","lastName":"Orman"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Open to GM, GR and Undergrad Students. \r\nNon-Johnson students may add themselves to the waitlists during their enrollment periods, however Johnson Students have priority into the classes and non-Johnsons will be enrolled: 1) IF seats are still available after Johnson students complete their enrollment period and 2) IF the instructor allows. \r\n** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\r\nDeadline to Change Grade Option: March 13th, 2015\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 13th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.  \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  January 29th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.  \r\nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 4th with permission of the faculty.

It created a new emphasis on information technologies and systems in management; led to the development of new technologies and new combinations of existing technologies to support management; and occasionally radically altered business practices and the role of management. Students in this course learn to conduct economic transactions and manage businesses on the Internet. All major technical and managerial issues are covered through computer exercises on the Internet and case studies and examples of businesses on the Internet.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":365543,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6029","titleShort":"NYC Technology Trek","titleLong":"NYC Technology Trek","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18072,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:00AM","timeEnd":"07:00PM","startDt":"03/06/2015","endDt":"03/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"wds4","firstName":"Wesley","middleName":"","lastName":"Sine"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"08:00AM","timeEnd":"03:00PM","startDt":"03/07/2015","endDt":"03/07/2015","instructors":[],"pattern":"S","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":3,"timeStart":"08:00AM","timeEnd":"03:00PM","startDt":"03/08/2015","endDt":"03/08/2015","instructors":[],"pattern":"Su","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"By Permission Only.

To manage supply chains effectively, one needs to develop the right product, coordinate information and material flows throughout the entire network and deliver the product at the right time at the right location. Since different supply chain partners may face different types of challenges and may have different objectives, it is difficult to coordinate information and material flows and even more difficult to entice these partners to collaborate. The goal of this course is to develop a better understanding of the challenges in managing supply chains. This course will be relevant for students considering careers in management consulting, general management and supply chain management.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: NCC 5080 or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":350610,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6430","titleShort":"Managerial Spreadsheet Model","titleLong":"Managerial Spreadsheet Modeling","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":14924,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"03/13/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":9,"netid":"dcj2","firstName":"David","middleName":"C.","lastName":"Juran"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 257-Parker","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH257","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Non-Johnson students may add themselves to the waitlists during the enrollment periods, however Johnson Students have priority into the classes and non-Johnsons will be enrolled: 1) IF seats are still available after Johnson students complete their enrollment period and 2) IF the instructor allows.\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 13th at 8:00am to January 28th at Noon.  \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  January 27th at 8:00am to January 28th at 4:00pm.  \r\nYou may add or drop a first-half class after January 28th with permission of the faculty.

Three methods of valuation are introduced: intrinsic valuation, relative valuation by multiples using comparables, and contingent claims valuation, based on a real options approach. The rest of the course will be dedicated to understanding each of these methods in greater detail and more importantly, applying them to the valuation of actual companies. This will involve understanding in detail discounted cash-flow models and the many inputs required to build them; dividend discount models; the determination and use of relative-value multiples such as price/earnings and price/book value; and finally, how to apply option theory to specific problems in valuation. The course includes a special session on valuation approaches and challenges specific to venture capital and private-equity investing. This will include a discussion of topics such as required internal rates of return (IRRs), the effects of leverage on valuation, and issues relating to the valuation of high-growth startups.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":364725,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6590","titleShort":"Mgmt of Financial Institutions","titleLong":"Management of Financial Institutions","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15004,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:55AM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"03/16/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"nhp7","firstName":"Nate","middleName":"","lastName":"Peck"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B06","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB06","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"GM and Grad Students ONLY\r\n** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\r\nDeadline to Change Grade Option: March 27th, 2015\r\nAdd/Drop permitted for ONE WEEK ONLY after class begins!

In the past, some students from the Engineering, Hotel, AEM (Dyson) and ILR programs have also attended this course. Impactful business leaders appreciate the importance of consumer insights. Many strategic decisions - such as introducing a new product, repositioning an existing product, or deciding whether to extend an existing brand or to introduce a new brand - are pivoted on consumer insights. In this course I will discuss how managers can uncover behavioral insights and use those insights to shape product marketing strategy. The course will cover the following four topics: CONSUMER INSIGHTS (What is consumer insight? What research methods can be used to uncover consumer insights?), POSITIONING &amp; BRANDING (Can you do the financial analysis required for a marketing plan? Why is positioning so important? Which segment should you target? Can intangible brand associations influence market shares? Should you extend your brand?  How is brand value measured?), INNOVATION (Do you have to be a pioneer to successfully innovate? How can new product diffusion be modeled? Is your category lifecycle slow-and-long or fast-and-short? How to test a concept? How can you optimize the attributes of your new concept? How can you forecast the sales of the new product?), PRICING &amp; ADVERTISING (Will a higher price help or hurt your brand? Does share-of-voice predict market share?). Please note that there is a significant overlap between the material taught in this course and the Strategic Brand Management course (NBA 6240) taught by me in the Strategic Marketing Immersion program. Therefore students, who have already attended the Strategic Marketing Immersion course will not be allowed to enroll for this course.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":350671,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6650","titleShort":"Strat Mgmt of Tech & Innov","titleLong":"The Strategic Management of Technology and Innovation","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12970,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"05:40PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":11,"netid":"rll36","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"Louis","lastName":"Laperle"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Open to GM and Grad Students Only\r\nNon-Johnson students may add themselves to the waitlists during the enrollment periods, however Johnson Students have priority into the classes and non-Johnsons will be enrolled: 1) IF seats are still available after Johnson students complete their enrollment period and 2) IF the instructor allows.\r\n** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\r\nDeadline to Change Grade Option: March 13th, 2015\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 13th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.  \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  January 29th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.  \r\nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 4th with permission of the faculty.

This course is designed for students who may someday work in, consult for, and/or create firms whose primary product is fundamentally related to technology or innovation. The course typically includes both M.B.A. students and graduate students in science. It starts by examining how industries are transformed by new technologies and how these patterns of industrial change generate both opportunity and high rates of firm failure. We will then explore the questions: Why do some technology leaders fail? and How do technology innovators successfully take on and replace incumbent firms? This leads to an examination of internal management issues, focusing on the design of innovative organizations: designing reward systems, managing growth, overcoming resistance to change, and using organizational culture to promote innovation.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":350695,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6710","titleShort":"Business Ethics","titleLong":"Business Ethics","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":14989,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:55AM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"03/16/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dmr42","firstName":"Dana","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Radcliffe"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B06","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB06","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"GM, Grad and UG Seniors Only\r\nNon-Johnson students may add themselves to the waitlists during the enrollment periods, however Johnson Students have priority into the classes and non-Johnsons will be enrolled: 1) IF seats are still available after Johnson students complete their enrollment period and 2) IF the instructor allows.\r\nNon-Johnson students must see their college registrar regarding policies connected with adding/dropping a second half Johnson School class.

This course is designed to enhance students' skills in moral reasoning as it applies to managerial decision making. It begins by examining normative concepts and principles that typically enter into moral reasoning, then uses those concepts and principles to analyze cases. Discussions are designed to help students understand the moral issues confronting the decision makers in the cases and explore how those issues might be addressed in ethically responsible ways.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":350723,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6780","titleShort":"Advanced Private Equity","titleLong":"Advanced Private Equity: Negotiations and Structuring","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12995,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"slg63","firstName":"Steven","middleName":"L.","lastName":"Greenberg"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 134","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH134","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Prerequisites: NBA 5640, NBA 3000, or permission of instructor. \r\nNon-Johnson students may add themselves to the waitlists during the enrollment periods, however Johnson Students have priority into the classes and non-Johnsons will be enrolled: 1) IF seats are still available after Johnson students complete their enrollment period and 2) IF the instructor allows.\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students - January 13th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.  \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  January 29th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.  \r\nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 4th with permission of the faculty.

In particular, you will be introduced to theories and processes of negotiation between people with very different assumptions and mindsets, such as negotiation between heads of offices in different national locations in the same organization, business executives working with their legal counsels to get a deal done, or managers working with their cross-border alliance partners. The course is designed to enhance the awareness of your assumptions and beliefs, and their impact on your dealing with different others. In addition, the course is designed to help students approach complex and often emotionally charged negotiations with confidence and resilience.
