Developmental questions begin with those we ask of all technology: at whose cost, to whose benefit? Social movements have arisen to block both the testing and commercializing of biotechnology products, arguing that the developmental consequences are negative. Their objections center on the issues of food sovereignty, effects of land use change on the environment, ownership of transgenic traits and the genetic background in which they are placed (intellectual property), environmental uncertainties/risks, control of the food supply by multinational corporations and human health issues.
