Organizations not only need an effective market strategy, but the ability to implement that strategy. Management and leadership issues abound in organizations, and people at every level of an organization are often asked to exercise leadership and make difficult decisions. There are two primary goals of this course, which are: (1) to help students build skill and fluency with the concepts and literature of management and organizational behavior, and (2) to help students better understand leadership issues at the individual, group, organizational, and societal level. The course will employ case studies, lectures, and class discussions to meet these goals.  ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"Non-Johnson School students only.
