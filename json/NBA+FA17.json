The course includes two parts. In the first part, students develop a set of core skills essential to financial statement analysis. We cover strategic ratio analysis, cash flow analysis, forecasting, proforma financial statements, and firm valuation using discounted cash flow and residual income techniques. The second part focuses on more advanced financial statement topics and specialized industries. We cover investment research, accounting analysis, credit analysis, banking, mergers and acquisitions, and issues relating to international financial statement analysis. The course emphasizes the practical application of the material using a combination of lecture, cases, and hands-on examples.  Students are evaluated based on a project and two exams.  The course presumes an understanding of basic corporate finance theory and basic financial accounting, but little or no previous experience in security valuation.

The course attempts to provide a general working knowledge of the financial system by examining not only how various intermediaries and markets work, but also their evolution over time.  The role of central banks, and their operations, is particularly emphasized, as is the nature of risk management both within the financial institution and more broadly for the financial system. Topics considered here include swaps, credit derivatives, value at risk models, and systemic risk. Just as intermediation has moved from institutions to markets, the course follows a similar evolution in the topics studied over the course of the semester. Market topics examined include securitization, the money markets, the Treasury market, and the financial crisis. Ethical issues in the financial markets are also examined.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: NCC 5060.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":350242,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5540","titleShort":"International Finance","titleLong":"International Finance","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13342,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"wbb1","firstName":"Warren","middleName":"B.","lastName":"Bailey"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"**Open to Johnson and Graduate Students Only\nPre-req: NCC 5060 or NCC 5560\nNO DROPS WILL BE ALLOWED AFTER THE LAST DAY OF ADD/DROP Instructor will NOT sign any late add/drop forms.\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students – August 15th at 8:00am thru September 5th at 4:00pm.

International finance is different in two basic respects: (1) the existence of multiple currencies adds risk to investment and financing decisions; (2) when corporations and portfolio investors cross international borders, both problems and opportunities arise. This course focuses on these issues and highlights how finance theory can be extended to address them. Students apply the basic principles of international finance to a variety of problems. The course helps students understand the ideas and research results of international finance and adapt what they learn to the practical problems in the increasingly globalized business world. The first part of the course outlines exchange rate volatility, barriers to international capital flows, and the value of international diversification. The second part presents a variety of problems, examples, and applications from the three basic themes described in part one. Spreadsheet assignments and a term project requiring data analysis develop research skills and illustrate academic concepts. Exams consist of computational, short answer, and short essay questions.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Graduate students only.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: NCC 5060 or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":350245,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5550","titleShort":"Fixed Inc &Int Rate Der","titleLong":"Fixed Income Securities and Interest Rate Options","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13257,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"raj15","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Jarrow"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***Johnson and Graduate Students Only ***\nLetter or S/U.

Over the spring and summer largely fortune 500 companies are solicited for projects that students can work on during the fall semester, with three to five days during the semester of on-site interaction with client companies at their location or on campus. The projects are done by teams of students, typically four to five, supported by both the faculty and an experienced adviser. Lecture material covers the approach to structuring complex problems, conducting analytical work and developing conclusions and recommendations. Student teams are expected to communicate regularly with their clients and to have at least one interim and final presentations. These experiential-learning projects will integrate the concepts and knowledge covered in the core courses and immersions as well as other fall electives. These client-critical projects typically incorporate the broad areas of strategy, operations, finance or marketing. Grading is a blend of client and faculty assessments.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: M.B.A. students only.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":368533,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5795","titleShort":"Advanced Strategic Analysis","titleLong":"Advanced Strategic Analysis","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15741,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"10/06/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"pmb234","firstName":"Peter","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Balnaves"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"*Open to Johnson Students Only*\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students – August 15th at 8:00am thru September 5th at 4:00pm.

What special challenges face women as they transition from students to managers to leaders? What do the latest research findings offer to women who are seeking C-level positions and the organizations that want to benefit from more women leaders? In this course, we will take a multi-pronged approach to learning about women and leadership to better prepare students of both genders to lead in organizations that are now comprised of nearly 50% women. To do this we will analyze case studies of women leaders pulled from a range of industries. We will review the current state of empirical evidence about the status of women as leaders, investigate the barriers that have made it more difficult for women to reach the top of the business world, and consider ways in which individuals and organizations can overcome them. Guest speakers will share their experiences with the class. Finally, there will be time to engage in deep reflection about what students expect from their careers, as well as a chance to consider the pathways they must take to become effective and inclusive leaders in increasingly diverse organizations.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":359203,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6150","titleShort":"Bus Chin in Cultural Context I","titleLong":"Business Chinese in Cultural Context I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":13410,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"zc46","firstName":"Zhihong","middleName":"","lastName":"Chen"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Prerequisite: two years (on heritage track) or three years of Chinese or equivalent.

To expand students' knowledge on various business-related issues, in addition to business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing, and listening exercises as well as clips of TV shows and interviews will also be provided. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues; analysis of the uniqueness of the Chinese financial market (banks, bond and stock market); discussion of Chinese business laws, translation of business terms and documents, and commercial language and word processing. Class will be in Chinese.

Three methods of valuation are introduced: intrinsic valuation, relative valuation by multiples using comparables, and contingent claims valuation, based on a real options approach. The rest of the course will be dedicated to understanding each of these methods in greater detail and more importantly, applying them to the valuation of actual companies. This will involve understanding in detail discounted cash-flow models and the many inputs required to build them; dividend discount models; the determination and use of relative-value multiples such as price/earnings and price/book value; and finally, how to apply option theory to specific problems in valuation. The course includes a special session on valuation approaches and challenges specific to venture capital and private-equity investing. This will include a discussion of topics such as required internal rates of return (IRRs), the effects of leverage on valuation, and issues relating to the valuation of high-growth startups.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":350667,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6630","titleShort":"Managerial Decision Making","titleLong":"Managerial Decision Making","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13260,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jer9","firstName":"J.","middleName":"","lastName":"Russo"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***JOHNSON AND GRAD STUDENTS ONLY*** \nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students – August 15th at 8:00am thru September 5th at 4:00pm.

In general, an organization cannot survive without the trust of numerous stakeholders, and ethical lapses destroy trust and threaten vital stakeholder relationships. In today's volatile and fiercely competitive business environment, a manager must be able to identify and effectively resolve ethical issues that inevitably arise in the pursuit of business (and career) objectives. This course is designed to enhance students' skills in moral reasoning as it applies to managerial decision making. It begins by examining normative concepts and principles that typically enter into moral reasoning, then uses those concepts and principles to analyze cases. Discussions are designed to help students understand the moral issues confronting the decision makers in the cases and explore how those issues might be addressed in ethically responsible ways.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":350704,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6730","titleShort":"Derivatives Securities Part I","titleLong":"Derivatives Securities Part I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15530,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"10/06/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":13,"netid":"dh634","firstName":"Darien","middleName":"","lastName":"Huang"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***GM, GR and UG Srs/Jrs Only***\n** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\nDeadline to Change Grading Option: September 19th\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students – August 15th at 8:00am thru September 5th at 4:00pm.
