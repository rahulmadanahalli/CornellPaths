This same question about the degree to which discourses and practices correspond might be asked of other countries, like the Soviet Union, China, and Britain, but this course examines the ways in which US foreign policy has been deployed over the course of the twentieth century and the ways those policies have been perceived and received by people living in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Particular case studies will be addressed stemming from the faculty's specializations (for example, Vietnam, Cambodia, Guatemala, and Chile) and the emphasis is on the role of the United States in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Prominent themes will include forms of subversion, from military muscle to economic coercion, and how and why they have changed over time; meanings of liberty, democracy, freedom, and sovereignty in different places and times; popular responses to policies and actions of foreign administrations; the relationships between sovereign states and transnational corporations; the uses and abuses of History in the formulation and justification of policy initiatives and in local responses to them; and the complexities involved in discerning internal and external forces in an increasingly transnational world.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":359454,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"LATA","catalogNbr":"2150","titleShort":"Contemporary Lat Am Survey","titleLong":"Contemporary Latin American Survey","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":5621,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":15,"netid":"jmh553","firstName":"Janet","middleName":"Marie","lastName":"Hendrickson"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Prerequisites: SPAN 2070 or 2090 or CASE Q+, or permission of instructor.

In the second section, we examine the Haitian Revolution in order to describe and interrogate the philosophical and historical relations between master and slave. In the third section, we look at writings such as the Communist manifesto and Che Guevara' essays in order to analyze the difficulties of articulating the relationship between man and socialism in Cuba. In the final section, we examine the problems of designating who constitutes the native \"we\" and the foreign \"them\" in the neoliberal economic revolution that is taking place in Jamaica; for this discussion, we will read Jamaica Kincaid's A Small Place and view Stephanie Black's film, Life and Debt.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Conducted in English.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: SPAN 2095 or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":367886,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"LATA","catalogNbr":"3015","titleShort":"Sweetness","titleLong":"Sweetness: How Sugar Built the Modern World","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16347,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"gla23","firstName":"Gerard","middleName":"Laurence","lastName":"Aching"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"3010","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Rice, wheat, and maize are examples of crops that sustained the civilizations in which they were cultivated for centuries. Sugar is different. Not only is sugar cane a relatively recent transplant, originating in Melanesia and South Asia, taken to the Middle East, and then cultivated extensively in the tropical regions of plantation America beginning in the 17th century. The sugar that it produces began as a luxury commodity and gradually became a household staple over the course of three centuries. This course examines key aspects of the transformation of sugar cane from plant to luxury commodity and then to staple, with particular emphasis on the impact that its cultivation and manufacturing had on the ecology, demography, diet, history, culture, economies, and politics of the Caribbean Basin. Sugar manufacturing in this region generated the enormous wealth that slave and indentured labor produced in and for transatlantic commerce for the three centuries that gave rise to the modern, western world. Given the importance of sugar at the time, sugar plantations were sites of some of the most ambitious experiments in science, industry, labor, and trade that the world had ever seen.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":350809,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"LATA","catalogNbr":"3550","titleShort":"Ancient

features of Mesoamerican cities, economies, political systems, religion.  We begin by considering Mesoamerican societies at the time of the Spanish invasion.  Our focus will be on descriptions of the Aztecs of Central Mexico by Europeans and indigenous survivors, in an attempt to extract from them a model of the fundamental organizational features of one Mesoamerican society, making allowances for what we can determine about the perspectives and biases of their authors.  We then review the precolumbian history of Mesoamerica looking for variations on these themes as well as indications of alternative forms of organization.  We will also look at such issues as the transition from mobile to sedentary lifeways, the processes involved in the domestication of plants and animals, the emergence of cities and states, and the use of invasion-period and ethnographic information to interpret precolumbian societies in comparative perspective.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":365499,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"LATA","catalogNbr":"3565","titleShort":"Art

precolumbian Americas.  The course provides a summary of the history of the region before the European invasion, but the emphasis is on the organization of Mesoamerican societies: the distinctive features of Mesoamerican cities, economies, political systems, religion.  We begin by considering Mesoamerican societies at the time of the Spanish invasion.  Our focus will be on descriptions of the Aztecs of Central Mexico by Europeans and indigenous survivors, in an attempt to extract from them a model of the fundamental organizational features of one Mesoamerican society, making allowances for what we can determine about the perspectives and biases of their authors.  We then review the precolumbian history of Mesoamerica looking for variations on these themes as well as indications of alternative forms of organization.  We will also look at such issues as the transition from mobile to sedentary lifeways, the processes involved in the domestication of plants and animals, the emergence of cities and states, and the use of invasion-period and ethnographic information to interpret precolumbian societies in comparative perspective.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":369366,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"LATA","catalogNbr":"6385","titleShort":"Urban
