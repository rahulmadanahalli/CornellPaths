As America's economic disparity widened over the last 40 years, public education successes have stalled. Many in the Middle and on the Right in America, educational reformers of all stripes, blame teachers, their unions, and collective bargaining for these \"failures.\" Their \"solutions,\" which we will carefully examine, include charter schools, testing of students, unilaterally created evaluations of teachers, and severe restrictions on collective bargaining. This course will address, through policy, legal, and political readings, what forms this struggle is taking in US public education and its workplaces. It will focus, in large part, on the sharpening conflict between the goals, agendas, and hopes of public school workers who now face challenges from politicians and liberal and conservative critics who see much to gain by arguing that public education success requires significant limitations of the bargaining and economic rights and power of teacher unions and their members. Graduate and undergraduate students from all colleges are encouraged to enroll.

Rather, it examines negotiation and bargaining generally, using examples drawn from several contexts, including employment relations, environmental disputes, real estate transactions, and other settings.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: background in economics and social sciences.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":355533,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"6012","titleShort":"Managing & Resolving Conflict","titleLong":"Managing and Resolving Conflict","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16210,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rs60","firstName":"Ronald","middleName":"","lastName":"Seeber"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 108","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS108","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"4012","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Deals with managing and resolving workplace conflicts and examines dispute resolution and conflict management in both union and nonunion settings.

In addition to focusing on how arbitrators manage hearings, the course will also cover the institutional and administrative arrangements that support the use of labor arbitration. How arbitrators are admitted to rosters and receive appointments from such \"providers\" as the American Arbitration Association, the Federal Mediation &amp; Conciliation Service, the New York State Public Employment Relations Board, the Cornell's ADR Services, etc.) will be examined. The rules used by Cornell and other providers will also be discussed.  The first day will conclude with a labor arbitration exercise and faculty debriefing.\nDuring the next segments of the course, students will examine contemporary practice issues such as discovery, subpoenas, pre-hearing briefs, and problems involving availability of witnesses. Detailed coverage of the standards of contract interpretation, discipline and the role of evidence will be provided. Throughout the course, role-plays and other assignments will test students' understanding of the critical role of the arbitrator in deciding labor disputes. All case examples will be drawn from actual disputes successfully arbitrated by the course's instructor.\nCourse requirements include a writing assignment assessing labor arbitration as a technique for resolving workplace disputes between employers and unions. Required reading assignments will be drawn from the specialized literature on arbitration and dispute resolution.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":350419,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"6022","titleShort":"Arbitration","titleLong":"Arbitration","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15165,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rll5","firstName":"Risa","middleName":"L.","lastName":"Lieberwitz"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 111","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS111","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"4022","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Study of arbitration in the field of labor-management relations, including an analysis of principles and practices, the law of arbitration, the handling of materials in briefs and oral presentations, the conduct of mock arbitration hearing, and the preparation of arbitration opinions and post-hearing briefs.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with ILRLR 4022.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: ILRLR 5000 and ILRLR 5010.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":365472,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"6023","titleShort":"Mediation: Theory and Practice","titleLong":"Mediation: Theory and Practice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16375,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:00PM","timeEnd":"10:00PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rms43","firstName":"Rocco","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Scanza"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 112","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS112","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6080","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course is offered to students interested in acquiring thorough knowledge of the theory and practice of mediation as well as the techniques employed by effective mediators.

As America's economic disparity widened over the last 40 years, public education successes have stalled. Many in the Middle and on the Right in America, educational reformers of all stripes, blame teachers, their unions, and collective bargaining for these \"failures.\" Their \"solutions,\" which we will carefully examine, include charter schools, testing of students, unilaterally created evaluations of teachers, and severe restrictions on collective bargaining.  This course will address, through policy, legal, and political readings, what forms this struggle is taking in US public education and its workplaces. It will focus, in large part, on the sharpening conflict between the goals, agendas, and hopes of public school workers who now face challenges from politicians and liberal and conservative critics who see much to gain by arguing that public education success requires significant limitations of the bargaining and economic rights and power of teacher unions and their members. Graduate and undergraduate students from all colleges are encouraged to enroll. Considerable reading assignments, class room discussion, and guest lectures will characterize our work.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with ILRLR 4865.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":355561,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"6870","titleShort":"Intro to Labor Research","titleLong":"Introduction to Labor Research","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17201,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"klb23","firstName":"Kate","middleName":"L.","lastName":"Bronfenbrenner"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"ILR Conference Center 329","bldgDescr":"ILR Conference Center","facilityDescrshort":"ICC329","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"4870","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Provides students interested in the labor field with the skills necessary to understand and use social science research as it relates to the labor movement.

This course begins in the late nineteenth century, defining it as a pivotal moment in U.S. immigration and labor history when efforts to regulate immigrant entry and naturalization became increasingly bureaucratized. As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective. We will also address questions regarding the perceived benefit and cost of immigration at both the national and local (i.e., community) levels. In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time. Finally, we will consider how immigrants have negotiated the pressures of their new surroundings, and challenged dominant conceptions of American national identity and citizenship in the process.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":367066,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"3068","titleShort":"Org forImmigrant Worker Rights","titleLong":"Organizing for Immigrant Worker Rights","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17487,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"smg338","firstName":"Shannon","middleName":"Marie","lastName":"Gleeson"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 219","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS219","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"LSP","catalogNbr":"3068","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This class examines the institutional processes of enforcing immigrant worker rights.

We look at how public entities have turned to worker organizations to help hold employers accountable, and how workers have turned to local governments to strengthen worker protections (such as higher minimum wages and strengthened penalties for wage theft), as well as how states have become new targets for policy change  (such as recent victories for domestic workers).  We also discuss binational efforts to advance immigrant worker rights.  We end by considering prospects for federal immigration reform, and the implications these proposals may have for immigrant worker rights.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":364839,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"3820","titleShort":"Gendered Workplace","titleLong":"Gendered Workplace","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":14672,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"iad1","firstName":"Ileen","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Devault"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 115","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS115","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Sat - Unsat Exclusively(SUI)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"3820","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course will examine the range of issues surrounding the experience of gender in the modern workplace.

Detailed coverage of the standards of contract interpretation, discipline and the role of evidence will be provided. Throughout the course, role-plays and other assignments will test students' understanding of the critical role of the arbitrator in deciding labor disputes.

A review of the theories of conflict, its roots and its resolution, set the stage for the role mediation can effectively play in resolving conflict. Students are introduced to the models of mediation and the benefits and challenges of each, including a comparative analysis of evaluative, facilitative and transformative styles of mediation. In the second segment, students will examine the impact of federal and state laws on the process. Significant attention will be devoted to the use of mediation in the public and federal sectors and in public sector negotiation impasses. The course will also explore the use of mediation across industries, including construction, securities, and commercial disputes.  The role of gender, race, culture, ethics and impasse in mediation will all be examined and incorporated into workshops and case studies. Through a series of workshops, students will have several opportunities to apply their knowledge of mediation and begin to develop the skills needed to become effective mediators.

Through lectures, readings, case studies, and research training and exercises the class will provide students with the tools to pose and answer basic questions on the operations, structure, and industrial relations strategies of corporate America. In particular this course will focus on how these company characteristics, structures, and practices impact on the firm's labor relations policies and strategies and how unions can best respond to and capitalize on these characteristics in union strategic organizing and bargaining campaigns. The course will also provide in-depth hands-on training in the on-line and library research tools required to conduct strategic corporate research. As part of this course students will work through a series of case studies dealing with diverse firms and industries, as well as have an opportunity to conduct in-depth research on an actual firm in the context of union organizing or bargaining.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"SU15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":350152,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"1100","titleShort":"Intro

We walk through claimsmaking in an array of federal and state administrative bureaucracies, including wage and hour, health and safety, and discrimination.  We also look at how the immigration enforcement regime intersects with the tenets of at-will employment to grant employers wide latitude in retaliating against undocumented workers and stifling attempts at legal mobilization.  We next assess how these formal protections are filtered through various institutional gatekeepers (including legal advocates and medical experts) and how organizational compliance structures (such as human resources and mediation programs) have limited worker¿s ability to make claims on their rights.  We consider how intersecting bases of inequality (such as gender, race, and national origin) are processed by administrative bureaucracies, and how lay versus legal conceptions of workplace justice often diverge.

Billionaire philanthropists say the same. They and public education's other critics agree that they do not like the educational outcomes produced in our public schools. These increasingly strident forces often blame the political power and the collectively bargained over agreements achieved by the national and local teacher unions  for student failings, high local tax rates, inflated salaries, and monopolistic labor market practices. This narrative and pursuit of policies thereunder are challenging the historic public education configuration in nearly every state.    This course will critically examine these forces and attempt to place their criticisms and suggestions in a policy, political, and legal perspective. Are those who sharply disagree with the current state of the public education system and workplace true reformers? Has our public education system failed, and if so, how do we know? Whether the system has failed or is ailing, what role have unions and their insistence, where allowed, upon exercising their political power and their right to collective bargaining, played in creating this societal tension? And, looking into the future, do we see the educational reformers and/or the unions and their think tank colleagues fashioning a viable set of constructive policies that will attract teachers and make it possible for our youth to learn? Answering these questions will be a challenge, but we will surely attempt to throughout our studies in this course.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":350326,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"4880","titleShort":"Justice","titleLong":"Justice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16831,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"meg3","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"Evan","lastName":"Gold"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 112","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS112","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Graded(GRI)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Examines major theories of justice and applies them to contemporary issues of the student's choice, such as affirmative action and reverse discrimination, income inequality, and gun control.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: junior or senior standing, or permission of instructor.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367612,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"6010","titleShort":"Union Organizing","titleLong":"Union Organizing","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18543,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"klb23","firstName":"Kate","middleName":"L.","lastName":"Bronfenbrenner"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 108","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS108","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Graded(GRI)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"4000","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Examines the theory, practice, and strategy of organizing in a global economy.

Classroom discussions, group exercise and readings will focus on the role of the labor arbitrator in the public and private sectors.\nDuring the first part of the course, topics will include the backgrounds, training, and certifications needed to establish a labor arbitration practice. In addition to focusing on how arbitrators manage hearings, the course will also cover the institutional and administrative arrangements that support the use of labor arbitration. How arbitrators are admitted to rosters and receive appointments from such \"providers\" as the American Arbitration Association, the Federal Mediation &amp; Conciliation Service, the New York State Public Employment Relations Board, the Cornell's ADR Services, etc.) will be examined. The rules used by Cornell and other providers will also be discussed.  The first day will conclude with a labor arbitration exercise and faculty debriefing.\nDuring the next segments of the course, students will examine contemporary practice issues such as discovery, subpoenas, pre-hearing briefs, and problems involving availability of witnesses. Detailed coverage of the standards of contract interpretation, discipline and the role of evidence will be provided. Throughout the course, role-plays and other assignments will test students' understanding of the critical role of the arbitrator in deciding labor disputes. All case examples will be drawn from actual disputes successfully arbitrated by the course's instructor.\nCourse requirements include a writing assignment assessing labor arbitration as a technique for resolving workplace disputes between employers and unions. Required reading assignments will be drawn from the specialized literature on arbitration and dispute resolution.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":365472,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"6023","titleShort":"Advanced Issues in Mediation","titleLong":"Advanced Issues in Mediation","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15702,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"10:30PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rms43","firstName":"Rocco","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Scanza"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"ILR Conference Center 225","bldgDescr":"ILR Conference Center","facilityDescrshort":"ICC225","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Graded(GRI)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6080","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course is offered to students interested in acquiring thorough knowledge of the theory and practice of mediation as well as the techniques employed by effective mediators.

A review of the theories of conflict, its roots and its resolution, set the stage for the role mediation can effectively play in resolving conflict. Students are introduced to the models of mediation and the benefits and challenges of each, including a comparative analysis of evaluative, facilitative and transformative styles of mediation. In the second segment, students will examine the impact of federal and state laws on the process. Significant attention will be devoted to the use of mediation in the public and federal sectors and in public sector negotiation impasses. The course will also explore the use of mediation across industries, including construction, securities, and commercial disputes.  The role of gender, race, culture, ethics and impasse in mediation will all be examined and incorporated into workshops and case studies. Through a series of workshops, students will have several opportunities to apply their knowledge of mediation and begin to develop the skills needed to become effective mediators.

Billionaire philanthropists say the same. They and public education's other critics agree that they do not like the educational outcomes produced in our public schools. These increasingly strident forces often blame the political power and the collectively bargained over agreements achieved by the national and local teacher unions  for student failings, high local tax rates, inflated salaries, and monopolistic labor market practices. This narrative and pursuit of policies thereunder are challenging the historic public education configuration in nearly every state.    This course will critically examine these forces and attempt to place their criticisms and suggestions in a policy, political, and legal perspective. Are those who sharply disagree with the current state of the public education system and workplace true reformers? Has our public education system failed, and if so, how do we know? Whether the system has failed or is ailing, what role have unions and their insistence, where allowed, upon exercising their political power and their right to collective bargaining, played in creating this societal tension? And, looking into the future, do we see the educational reformers and/or the unions and their think tank colleagues fashioning a viable set of constructive policies that will attract teachers and make it possible for our youth to learn? Answering these questions will be a challenge, but we will surely attempt to throughout our studies in this course.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":355579,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"9800","titleShort":"Workshop in LR, Law, and Hist","titleLong":"Workshop in Labor Relations, Law and History","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15602,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:30PM","timeEnd":"06:00PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"jrc32","firstName":"Jefferson","middleName":"R.","lastName":"Cowie"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 381","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS381","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Sat - Unsat Exclusively(SUI)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Provides a forum for the presentation of current research being undertaken by faculty members and graduate students in the Department of Labor Relations, History, and Law, and by invited guests.

We begin by reviewing the legal foundations of immigrant labor, including the current immigration enforcement regime, and the role of legal status in labor standards enforcement protections. We examine how organized labor has evolved with regards to immigrant workers, shifting from supporting employer sanctions in 1986, to repudiating them as a tool for employer control in 2001. We then evaluate the role that immigrant workers have played in the revitalization of the labor movement, and the challenges that remain for unions. Beyond unions, we examine the emergence of new forms of worker representation, including the varying types of worker centers. We focus on the proliferation of day labor centers, and more recently, non-union efforts to organize workers in the restaurant industry. We even consider the role of undocumented workers in the public sector, made possible through the increased use of subcontracting. We look at how public entities have turned to worker organizations to help hold employers accountable, and how workers have turned to local governments to strengthen worker protections (such as higher minimum wages and strengthened penalties for wage theft), as well as how states have become new targets for policy change (such as recent victories for domestic workers). We will also discuss binational efforts to advance immigrant worker rights.

This course begins in the late nineteenth century, defining it as a pivotal moment in U.S. immigration and labor history when efforts to regulate immigrant entry and naturalization became increasingly bureaucratized. As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective. We will also address questions regarding the perceived benefit and cost of immigration at both the national and local (i.e., community) levels. In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time. Finally, we will consider how immigrants have negotiated the pressures of their new surroundings, and challenged dominant conceptions of American national identity and citizenship in the process.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":367939,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"3300","titleShort":"Argumentation

In addition to focusing on how arbitrators manage hearings, the course will also cover the institutional and administrative arrangements that support the use of labor arbitration. How arbitrators are admitted to rosters and receive appointments from such \"providers\" as the American Arbitration Association, the Federal Mediation &amp; Conciliation Service, the New York State Public Employment Relations Board, the Cornell's ADR Services, etc.) will be examined. The rules used by Cornell and other providers will also be discussed.  The first day will conclude with a labor arbitration exercise and faculty debriefing.\nDuring the next segments of the course, students will examine contemporary practice issues such as discovery, subpoenas, pre-hearing briefs, and problems involving availability of witnesses. Detailed coverage of the standards of contract interpretation, discipline and the role of evidence will be provided. Throughout the course, role-plays and other assignments will test students' understanding of the critical role of the arbitrator in deciding labor disputes. All case examples will be drawn from actual disputes successfully arbitrated by the course's instructor.\nCourse requirements include a writing assignment assessing labor arbitration as a technique for resolving workplace disputes between employers and unions.

We begin by reviewing the conditions of post-industrial labor in an era of declining unionization and weak federal and state protections. Next we review theories of legal consciousness and legal mobilization, which help explain the conditions under which low-wage workers learn about their rights and come forward to demand justice.  We walk through claimsmaking in an array of federal and state administrative bureaucracies, including wage and hour, health and safety, and discrimination.  We also look at how the immigration enforcement regime intersects with the tenets of at-will employment to grant employers wide latitude in retaliating against undocumented workers and stifling attempts at legal mobilization.  We next assess how these formal protections are filtered through various institutional gatekeepers (including legal advocates and medical experts) and how organizational compliance structures (such as human resources and mediation programs) have limited worker¿s ability to make claims on their rights.  We consider how intersecting bases of inequality (such as gender, race, and national origin) are processed by administrative bureaucracies, and how lay versus legal conceptions of workplace justice often diverge.  We end by considering the fallout of workplace abuse on individuals and their families.\t\r\n\r\nThis course fulfills the ILR Advanced Writing requirement.

Accordingly, it is co-taught with psychologist Steve Ceci, and is organized around highly controversial \"must-read\" books on diverse topics that expose students to fundamental puzzles about human behavior and social interaction. The readings, combined with guest lectures by the authors, introduce students to disciplinary similarities and differences in the perspectives, theories, concepts, assumptions, and methods used by sociologists (who focus on what happens between individuals) and psychologists (who focus on what happens within). The authors vary from year to year but include Malcolm Gladwell, Michelle Alexander, Nate Silver, and Nicholas Christakis. All authors have agreed to participate in a \"Q&amp;A\" session with the students. The course meets Cornell's SBA distribution requirement.\n \n ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"A University Course -

The goal of the class will be to expose students to the breadth of disputes to which alternative dispute resolution is now being used in environmental conflicts and to be able to compare and contrast the styles of mediation used in these matters.  Students will learn how these principles are applied in real environmental situations.  A key objective of the course is to enable students to both understand and think critically about the strengths and weaknesses of using alternative dispute resolution procedures to manage environmental conflicts.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall (weeks

This course begins in the late nineteenth century, defining it as a pivotal moment in U.S. immigration and labor history when efforts to regulate immigrant entry and naturalization became increasingly bureaucratized. As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective. We will also address questions regarding the perceived benefit and cost of immigration at both the national and local (i.e., community) levels. In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time. Finally, we will consider how immigrants have negotiated the pressures of their new surroundings, and challenged dominant conceptions of American national identity and citizenship in the process.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":367939,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"3300","titleShort":"Argumentation

rhetorical inquiry into whether and when the technological change engendered by digitization and the so-called \"Information Technology (IT) Revolution\" benefits workers.  We then consider the broader impact of recent technological advances on manufacturing and fabrication, low- and semi-skilled service work, i.e., restaurant servers and bus drivers, and even on expert and professional work like that to which most of you presumably aspire.  Among the central themes is the notion that technology does not unilaterally act upon workers, their employers, or society-at-large.  Rather, workers, managers, customers, institutions, and policymakers shape which advances take hold and which do not, the ways that these technologies are deployed in the workplace, and the ways that society can actively mitigate the costs to technological advancement while harnessing its benefits.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":350326,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"4880","titleShort":"Justice","titleLong":"Justice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17048,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"meg3","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"Evan","lastName":"Gold"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Ives

We begin by reviewing the conditions of post-industrial labor in an era of declining unionization and weak federal and state protections. Next we review theories of legal consciousness and legal mobilization, which help explain the conditions under which low-wage workers learn about their rights and come forward to demand justice.  We walk through claimsmaking in an array of federal and state administrative bureaucracies, including wage and hour, health and safety, and discrimination.  We also look at how the immigration enforcement regime intersects with the tenets of at-will employment to grant employers wide latitude in retaliating against undocumented workers and stifling attempts at legal mobilization.  We next assess how these formal protections are filtered through various institutional gatekeepers (including legal advocates and medical experts) and how organizational compliance structures (such as human resources and mediation programs) have limited worker¿s ability to make claims on their rights.  We consider how intersecting bases of inequality (such as gender, race, and national origin) are processed by administrative bureaucracies, and how lay versus legal conceptions of workplace justice often diverge.  We end by considering the fallout of workplace abuse on individuals and their families.\t\r\n\r\nThis course fulfills the ILR Advanced Writing requirement.

We begin by reviewing the legal foundations of immigrant labor, including the current immigration enforcement regime, and the role of legal status in labor standards enforcement protections.  We examine how organized labor has evolved with regards to immigrant workers, shifting from supporting employer sanctions in 1986, to repudiating them as a tool for employer control in 2001.  We then evaluate the role that immigrant workers have played in the revitalization of the labor movement, and the challenges that remain for unions.  Beyond unions, we examine the emergence of new forms of worker representation, including the varying types of worker centers.  We focus on the proliferation of day labor centers, and more recently, non-union efforts to organize workers in the restaurant industry.  We even consider the role of undocumented workers in the public sector, made possible through the increased use of subcontracting. We look at how public entities have turned to worker organizations to help hold employers accountable, and how workers have turned to local governments to strengthen worker protections (such as higher minimum wages and strengthened penalties for wage theft), as well as how states have become new targets for policy change  (such as recent victories for domestic workers).  We also discuss binational efforts to advance immigrant worker rights.  We end by considering prospects for federal immigration reform, and the implications these proposals may have for immigrant worker rights.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":362999,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"3071","titleShort":"Governing Economic Development","titleLong":"Governing Economic Development: The U.S. Experience","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16332,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ra40","firstName":"Ronald","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Applegate"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Surveys the history of U.S. Economic development from the perspective of the governance structures created to organize and control economic activity, emphasizing the changing regulatory roles of public and private institutions.

Each seminar member is part of a two or three-person team that leads the discussion together, under the supervision of a graduate teaching assistant. Seminar meetings are devoted to building lesson plans for leading an effective discussion of each of the six books. The authors vary from year to year but include Malcolm Gladwell, Michelle Alexander, Nate Silver, and Nicholas Christakis.

In addition to focusing on how arbitrators manage hearings, the course will also cover the institutional and administrative arrangements that support the use of labor arbitration. How arbitrators are admitted to rosters and receive appointments from such \"providers\" as the American Arbitration Association, the Federal Mediation &amp; Conciliation Service, the New York State Public Employment Relations Board, the Cornell's ADR Services, etc.) will be examined. The rules used by Cornell and other providers will also be discussed.  The first day will conclude with a labor arbitration exercise and faculty debriefing.\nDuring the next segments of the course, students will examine contemporary practice issues such as discovery, subpoenas, pre-hearing briefs, and problems involving availability of witnesses. Detailed coverage of the standards of contract interpretation, discipline and the role of evidence will be provided. Throughout the course, role-plays and other assignments will test students' understanding of the critical role of the arbitrator in deciding labor disputes.

Students practice hands-on work in interpreting contract language and preparing and presenting grievances and unfair labor practices.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: ILRLR 2010, ILRLR 2050.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":368414,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"4052","titleShort":"Making Development Equitable","titleLong":"Making Development Equitable: Community Control in the New Economy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16830,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"03/16/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ra40","firstName":"Ronald","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Applegate"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"03/16/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"7W1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"03/16/2018","sessionLong":"Seven Week - First"}],"description":"This course examines the emergence of community-based organizations as agents of economic development, emphasizing their actions to introduce an alternative approach to development that stresses the equitable outcomes needed to sustain communities, and assessing their role in reconfiguring development goals and practices to form the \"social economy\" in the US and around the world.

technological change engendered by digitization and the so-called \"Information Technology (IT) Revolution\" benefits workers.  We then consider the broader impact of recent technological advances on manufacturing and fabrication, low- and semi-skilled service work, i.e., restaurant servers and bus drivers, and even on expert and professional work like that to which most of you presumably aspire.  Among the central themes is the notion that technology does not unilaterally act upon workers, their employers, or society-at-large.  Rather, workers, managers, customers, institutions, and policymakers shape which advances take hold and which do not, the ways that these technologies are deployed in the workplace, and the ways that society can actively mitigate the costs to technological advancement while harnessing its benefits.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["You

Long-term and structural changes in the economy and society have driven this trend. Such changes have included the shift from a manufacturing based- to a service based-economy, implementation of labor-saving business strategies and technologies, the reduction of unionization rates and globalization-triggered immigration. The growth of precarious employment raises broad reaching research and policy questions about the future of work globally. This course will address these questions as well as proposed solutions.
