Through case studies of familial and conjugal love in Africa, Asia, the US, Europe, and South and Latin America, the course will examine the debates about and enactment's of what constitutes the appropriate way to show love and affection in different cultures and historical contexts. Among the themes we will explore are questions of sexuality, marriage, kinship, and gender rights. A final unit will examine these themes through modern technologies such as the Internet, scientific advances in medicine, and a growing awareness that who and how we love is anything but simple or universal.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":363820,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"LGBT","catalogNbr":"2290","titleShort":"Intro to LGBT studies","titleLong":"Introduction to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":10080,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"csh34","firstName":"Cary","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Howie"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"White Hall 110","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT110","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"2290","type":"C"},{"subject":"FREN","catalogNbr":"2280","type":"C"},{"subject":"ITAL","catalogNbr":"2280","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Since roughly the middle of the nineteenth century, it has become important for some of us, in some parts of the world, to identify ourselves according to categories such as gender and sexuality, categories further subdivided along some of the lines suggested by the acronym LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender).

Today, some of the most heated debates surrounding feminism, identity politics, and Black women are framed within the broad contours of hip hop. This course will explore how women are portrayed in hip hop music and culture, addressing women both as consumers and producers. We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and peripheral female artists use hip hop to affirm their sexual power, articulate Black feminism, and create spaces for their artistic expression. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, performance studies, and queer of color critique to complicate the ways in which women, gender, and sexuality are represented in hip hop music. While our analyses will center on music and on the United States, we will also consider art, fashion, and dance within Black, Latina, and Caribbean interactions with hip hop. The course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about Black women's conceptualizations of feminism? How can we apply early \"hip hop feminism\" to understand current debates about Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? What are the relationships between queer theory and hip hop studies? Does hip hop allow spaces for alternative femininities? How do Black girls use hip hop as a pedagogical tool? The course will also address broader questions related to representations of Black femininity, people of color in the media, gender and sexual identity construction.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":368152,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"LGBT","catalogNbr":"4602","titleShort":"Queer Origins","titleLong":"Queer Origins","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17645,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"kjo3","firstName":"Kevin","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Ohi"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"A D White House 110","bldgDescr":"A D White House","facilityDescrshort":"ADW110","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"4902","type":"C"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4602","type":"C"},{"subject":"SHUM","catalogNbr":"4602","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Exploring questions of narrative perspective in relation to embodied desire, this seminar will weave together four different areas of study: theories of perspective, focalization, narrative voice, and free indirect style; accounts of the history of the novel, particularly in relation to interiority and psychology; philosophical and psychoanalytic considerations of the relation between cognition and embodiment, abstraction and visceral reality; and works in queer theory that can be read as adumbrating an erotics of impersonality. Among other goals, the course will attempt to think about a tension within queer theory—between, most generally, the abstraction and specification of embodied desires.  That tension is not to be resolved; the particular case of narrative perspective might point to ways that, unresolved, it might illuminate queer theory's debt to, and relevance for, the literary.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.
