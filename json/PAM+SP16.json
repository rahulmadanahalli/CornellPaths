We move on to several basic policy rationales for intervention in a market. Those include externalities, public goods, natural monopoly, and contracting problems, among others. We consider various forms of intervention, including taxes and subsidies, industry and economy-wide regulation, as well as innovative approaches such as tradable property rights and permits. Both normative and positive theories of regulation are examined, including the capture, economic (or private interest), pure public interest, and hybrid theories. Those approaches are applied to specific types of regulation, including individual industry-level regulation (e.g. electricity, trucking, postal services), as well as to broader social regulation (e.g. health, safety, environment).

We will next consider situations in which linear regression will yield biased estimates of the population parameters of interest, with particular attention paid to measurement error, selection on unobservables, and omitted variables. The course will end with an introduction to extensions of the linear regression model, including models for binary and categorical outcomes. While statistical modeling is the focus of the course, we proceed with the assumption that models are only as good as the theoretical and substantive knowledge behind them. Thus, in covering the technical material, we will spend considerable time discussing the link between substantive knowledge and statistical practice.

Both normative and positive theories of regulation are examined, including the capture, economic (or private interest), pure public interest, and hybrid theories. Those approaches are applied to specific types of regulation, including individual industry-level regulation (e.g. electricity, trucking, postal services), as well as to broader social regulation (e.g. health, safety, environment).

It refers to any organizational form that people use to create teams or groups that focus on achieving a specific purpose. Firms provide a structure through which people can organize themselves into those groups or teams. They are categorized by the nature of the property rights owners hold in the firm, and by the details of the firm's contractual arrangements. Common firm types include partnerships, sole proprietorships, non-profits, mutuals, and publicly traded corporations, among others. This course focuses on one important firm type: the modern publicly traded, privately owned corporation. The course uses economic and statistical analysis to study the interaction of the public corporation, the market, and the law, and how those interactions affect the welfare of managers, shareholders and consumers. The costs and benefits of that standard corporate form of organization are examined. A variety of legal institutions, some of which have evolved over decades, are analyzed. Those institutions define and govern the corporation. They include limited liability, fiduciary duties, the business judgment rule, and shareholder voting. The mechanisms of corporate governance, i.e., those legal and market-based forces that help control the corporation and ensure that managers operate it in shareholders' interest, are examined. Corporate governance mechanisms include hostile takeovers, insider trading, outside directors on the board, the monitoring role of institutional investors, audits, and executive compensation plans. State corporate law and anti-takeover devices are also discussed. The role and impact of federal policies, such as the 1933-34 Exchange Acts, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act in affecting corporate structure and managerial behavior will be an important focus. Other institutions and policies related to publicly traded corporations, such as sovereign wealth funds and government-sponsored enterprises, will also be examined along the way.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: Principles of Microeconomics; Principles of Statistics.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Students will be able to explain what a publicly traded corporation is, how it is organized, why it exists, its benefits and costs to society, how it is governed, controlled, and regulated, and its broader role in society.","Be able to describe the structure and effect of the law and policy surrounding the public corporation.","Students will be able to analyze and engage in policy controversies surrounding the corporation.","Students will be able to explain and demonstrate the role and importance of alternative organizational forms, including private partnerships, mutuals, and non-profit enterprises."],"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"HE"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":367829,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PAM","catalogNbr":"5400","titleShort":"Economics of Consumer Policy","titleLong":"Economics of Consumer Policy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17872,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"st96","firstName":"Sharon","middleName":"","lastName":"Tennyson"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall 280","bldgDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MVR280","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"PAM","catalogNbr":"3400","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":null,"catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"HE"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":352029,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PAM","catalogNbr":"5470","titleShort":"Microecon for Mgmt & Policy","titleLong":"Microeconomics for Management and Policy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":14196,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sak272","firstName":"Samuel","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Kleiner"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall 157","bldgDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MVR157","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Priority enrollment for Sloan students."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Introduces microeconomic theory and its application to decision making in the management and policy arenas.

Finally, we will explore extensions of the linear regression model, including models for categorical outcomes and hierarchical linear modeling. While statistical modeling is the focus of the course, we proceed with the assumption that models are only as good as the theoretical and substantive knowledge behind them. Thus, in covering the technical material, we will spend considerable time discussing the link between substantive knowledge and statistical practice.
