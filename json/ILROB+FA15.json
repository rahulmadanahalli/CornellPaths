This course introduces students to ongoing social scientific debates about the sources and consequences of inequality, as well as the types of public policy that might appropriately be pursued to reduce (or increase) inequality. These topics will be addressed in related unites, some of which include guest lectures by faculty from other universities (funded by the Center for the Study of Inequality).

It can be planned or unplanned, proactive or reactive, and it can involve fundamental transformation or only incremental adjustments. This course examines organizational change from both a theoretical and practical perspective. To do so, the course pairs readings drawn from Sociology and Social Psychology with case studies and in-class exercises that put you inside real organizations and give you experience making decisions in the face of ambiguous and incomplete information. We focus first on the tensions that arise when establishing and changing the design and structure of an organization. Next, we consider change in organizational culture-the assumptions, norms, and practices shared by members or a group or organization. In the final module, we examine how individuals within organizations lead and manage change.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: ILROB 1220.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367299,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILROB","catalogNbr":"3280","titleShort":"Competing with Social Networks","titleLong":"Competing with Social Networks","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16919,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"omk4","firstName":"Olga","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Khessina"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 108","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS108","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Graded(GRI)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Social networks are an important part of our life.  We rely on personal networks to meet new people, to find a new job, to make our friendships stronger.
