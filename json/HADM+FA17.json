Students will work with BMFiddle as a tool to model a business idea in the cloud for collaborative feedback, eventually using it as the base for the creation of a strategic technology plan that integrates many types of cloud-based technology vendors (Google Apps, Grasshopper, Smartsheet, Salesforce, etc…) to maximize the execution and growth of a start-up entity or add value to an existing venture at the lowest possible cost. The objectives of the course are achieved through entrepreneurial pitching activities, hospitality case studies, alumni interview case development, reflective assignments, and a strategic technology business planning project.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Winter, spring, summer.","catalogComments":"Elective.

The intent of this course is to provide a cornerstone experience from which students can build their entrepreneurial education through other entrepreneurship courses. Entrepreneurship is approached as a way of thinking and acting, as an attitude and a behavior. The course will emphasize entrepreneurship as a manageable process that can be applied in virtually any organizational setting. Further, it is a course that mixes theory with practice, and you will be challenged to apply principles, concepts and frameworks to real world situations. Opportunity recognition is the very basis from which entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial activity begins. Research shows that opportunity recognition is a learned behavior and as such this course will also seek to provide students with a better understanding of opportunity recognition through an exploration of the skills, tools, and mindset to generate new business ideas.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall (weeks 8-14), spring (weeks 1-7).","catalogComments":"Elective.  Enrollment limited to graduate students by permission only.  Undergraduates must enroll in HADM 4144.  A \"W\" will be issued for students dropping the class after week two.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"BU"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":367133,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"HADM","catalogNbr":"6145","titleShort":"Strategic Business Plan Dvlpmt","titleLong":"Strategic Business Plan Development","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13626,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"nt266","firstName":"Neil","middleName":"","lastName":"Tarallo"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Undergraduate students must enroll in HADM 4145."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"HADM","catalogNbr":"4145","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"A course for students who wish to learn the disciplines involved in creating and writing a well-grounded, concise business plan for a start-up concept, existing business, or corporate growth strategy in either a for profit or nonprofit context.
