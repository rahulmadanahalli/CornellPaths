Students are introduced to the historical development of disability public policy and to contemporary practices in implementing these policies at the state and organizational levels. Students explore the multiple areas of public policy relevant to persons with disabilities, including veterans legislation, worker's compensation, vocational rehabilitation, workforce development, social insurance, and civil rights legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Throughout the class, students will consider the relationship between disability employment policy and larger social and political developments. Students also will analyze how public policies have developed in practice, bridging the divides between policy as written, policy as implemented, and policy as practiced.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.
