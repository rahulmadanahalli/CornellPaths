They communicate using various types of documents (e.g., emails, memos, problem analyses, proposals, progress reports), give oral presentations, and incorporate graphics in their oral and written work. Students learn how to communicate specialized information to different audiences (e.g., technical and nontechnical audiences, colleagues and clients, peers and supervisors, and in-house departments), work in teams, and address organizational and ethical issues. The course material is drawn from professional contexts, principally engineering, and it generates lively discussion. The class size ensures close attention to each student's work.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CE-EN)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"May be used as free or approved elective in expressive arts.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: two first-year writing seminars and affiliation with a major.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Fulfills college technical-writing requirement.
