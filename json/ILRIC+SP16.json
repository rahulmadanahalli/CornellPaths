Themes covered are personal values and ethics, professional etiquette working with diverse communities and organizations, project planning, critical reflection and community engagement in a cross-cultural context. Preparation includes the development of skills in critical reflection in order to document, communicate and apply what has been learned from the field experience. The course is intended for any student undertaking study abroad, fieldwork, and community engagement in the near future. ALS 3200 is one credit course and students are required to attend all five sessions.

work together within a workplace or virtually.  Worker representatives find it increasingly difficult to negotiate or enforce collective agreements as the boundaries between firms and sectors become
