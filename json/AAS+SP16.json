We will analyze major themes such as race and class relations, gender and the family, immigration and globalization, religion and community activism. In the first half of this course, we will learn fundamental concepts and ideas by examining major events, including the Asian American Movement, the murder of Vincent Chin, and the LA Uprisings. In the second half of this course, we will examine how race and gender relations change alongside contemporary moments of globalization and the economy through a variety of topics including interracial marriages, refugees and welfare, the Tiger Mother, and affirmative action.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":357919,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AAS","catalogNbr":"2620","titleShort":"Intro to Asian Am Lit","titleLong":"Introduction to Asian American Literature","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":7028,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ssw6","firstName":"Sunn","middleName":"Shelley","lastName":"Wong"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 236","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH236","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2620","type":"C"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"2620","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course will introduce both a variety of writings by Asian North American authors and some critical issues concerning the production and reception of Asian American texts.

This course takes a historical, cultural, and social perspective of the rise of the Asian American Middle Class from the late nineteenth century to the current day. How did Asian Americans become part of the American middle class? Did the middle class experience racism differently compared to the working class? And although many Asian Americans strived to belong to the middle class, what are the limits of middle-class Asian American politics and lifestyle? We will cover topics such as immigration, imperialism, family politics, second generation, popular culture, model minority, education, and suicides.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":367791,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AAS","catalogNbr":"4509","titleShort":"Temporalities of Empire","titleLong":"Temporalities of Empire, Nation and Colonial Difference","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17482,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"vpm1","firstName":"Viranjini","middleName":"P.","lastName":"Munasinghe"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"A D White House 110","bldgDescr":"A D White House","facilityDescrshort":"ADW110","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"4109","type":"C"},{"subject":"SHUM","catalogNbr":"4509","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course asks how do racialization projects constitutive of modern European empire figure in the making of nation states? How in particular did anticipation of rights bearing European publics, enshrining post Enlightenment values, implicate/disturb the linear narrative of nation states emerging from the ruins of empire? We will explore the temporal entanglements between racialization logics of empire and nation, one demanding difference the other, sameness.  What are the logics and ambivalences of racialization when time of empire requiring difference is also the time of nation, requiring sameness?  What are implications of such an entanglement for postcolonial nations? How do inherited racializations set limits on postcolonial aspirations for homogeneity?  How does postcolonial homogeneity also produce difference in demarcation of the rights bearing subject of the nation?","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":365712,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AAS","catalogNbr":"4555","titleShort":"Race and Time","titleLong":"Race and Time","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15381,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ssw6","firstName":"Sunn","middleName":"Shelley","lastName":"Wong"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Stimson Hall 105","bldgDescr":"Stimson Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STM105","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AAS","catalogNbr":"6995","type":"B"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"4550","type":"B"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"6995","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Race, comparison, and time—what do these terms have to do with each other?
