Readings and discussions focus on the intersections of labor, human rights, and international trade law and policy in this new global economic context. A prior course in a related topic may be helpful but is not required-the first classes are meant to establish a foundation in each area. While the role of law is a unifying theme, the course is more policy-oriented than legalistic. After the introductory classes on labor rights, human rights, and trade, the focus turns to a series of topics that reflect the links between labor rights and trade, followed by thematic treatment of migrant workers, women workers, and child labor.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with ILRIC 4344.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: ILRLR 5010.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":362677,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRIC","catalogNbr":"6350","titleShort":"Labor Markets, Income Distribu","titleLong":"Labor Markets and Income Distribution in Developing Economies","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":14708,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"10:00PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"gsf2","firstName":"Gary","middleName":"","lastName":"Fields"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 105","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS105","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"ILRIC 6350 is open to undergraduate students who have completed ILRLE 2400 or ECON 3030."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Graded(GRI)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The course covers three major topics: labor markets in the developing world, distribution and development: theory and evidence, and policies to deal with these issues.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: ECON 3030Â orÂ ILRLE 2400Â or ILRLE 5400.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL"}]
