Most of the selection and priority of these topics is guided by the interest (and votes) of participants. Recent topics have included: affect in decision making, attention (allocation and focus), coherence/consistency of beliefs, fluency, goals, individual differences, information distortion, memory, methods, neuroscience, non-conscious processes, self-control-regulatory focus-ego depletion, and System 1 versus System 2. Students taking this course for credit are expected (a) to lead the discussions for several of the weekly topics, including the selection of the articles assigned as readings and the development of study questions and (b) to prepare a final paper that is presented in preliminary oral form during one of the last class meetings. The paper can review a body of literature, present a new theory or framework, or report an original experiment (or only a proposal for an experiment). Auditors are only expected to lead several weekly sessions.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"","catalogComments":"Graduate standing.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":362109,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NRE","catalogNbr":"5170","titleShort":"PhD Seminar in Org Behavior","titleLong":"PhD Seminar in Organizational Behavior","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16688,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:50PM","timeEnd":"05:50PM","startDt":"02/03/2015","endDt":"03/17/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"yc659","firstName":"Ya-Ru","middleName":"","lastName":"Chen"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"04:00PM","startDt":"01/30/2015","endDt":"01/30/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"yc659","firstName":"Ya-Ru","middleName":"","lastName":"Chen"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 131","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH131","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":3,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"12:00PM","startDt":"03/24/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"yc659","firstName":"Ya-Ru","middleName":"","lastName":"Chen"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Add/Drop Dates:  Non-Johnson Students ONLY:  January 13th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.

This entails reading many seminal pieces and several broad overview articles that will cover the classic areas of research in the field. We will also read more cutting-edge papers that reanalyze and reframe many of the classic variables of micro-OB, trying to alter the dominant perspective, bring in new theory, and integrate conflicting approaches. Be forewarned that achievement of these course objectives will require a significant, yet manageable, amount of reading. It is critical that you read the assigned materials before class and spend some time thinking about the implications of the readings, both separately and as a collection. We will use these readings to gain a sense of the theoretical progress of and diversity in the field, not as a set of findings that are simply to be digested or summated.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":367019,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NRE","catalogNbr":"5200","titleShort":"PhD Seminar - Arch Res In Acct","titleLong":"PhD Seminar - Archival Research in Accounting","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16705,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sb235","firstName":"Sanjeev","middleName":"","lastName":"Bhojraj"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Add/Drop Dates:  Non-Johnson Students ONLY:  January 13th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.
