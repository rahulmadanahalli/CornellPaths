Topics include examination of the ways in which class relates to social and public space and urban space as performance. Additional course work in film production, performance, and writing allows students to re-inscribe their spatial/corporeal experiences into an alternative exhibition space of the city street or the written page. In addition, each student will be required to produce formal textual documentation and full textual analyses of this process and final performance, installation, or text-based product.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2664,"crseId":367228,"crseOfferNbr":4,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4412","titleShort":"History & Identity Sports Film","titleLong":"Playing out Difference: History and Identity in Sports Film","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1480,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:45PM","startDt":"05/31/2017","endDt":"06/23/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

Additionally, we will examine how social issues are understood in sporting terms and concepts, such as: the hero and the underdog; urban and rural; natural talent versus hard work; and the individual versus team identity.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"}]
