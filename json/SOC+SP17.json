start you thinking sociologically about yourself and the broader social world.  To think sociologically is to recognize that being embedded in the world constrains behavior, and that individuals are both social actors and social products.  To think sociologically is also to recognize that our contemporary world, with its enduring cultural, political, and economic institutions, is as much a social product as we are.  We will begin by covering theoretical and methodological foundations of the sociological perspective.  We will go on to explore the concept of social stratification and will survey primary axes of social difference.  In the second half of the course we will look more closely at how individuals relate to each other, how social inequality is enacted and reinforced in everyday life, and at the way in which the organization of social life shapes individuals and groups, such as through social networks, residential neighborhoods, schooling, families, and on-line communication.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"Forbidden Overlap: Students may not receive credit for both SOC 1101 and DSOC

This course considers development as an evolving world project and from the perspective of its social and ecological impact: asking questions about costs and benefits of economic growth, about the global context (geo-political, institutional, production, consumption, and discursive relations), and the sustainability of various models. We relate development trends in the South/Third World with those in the North/First World. We also examine shared, global issues, such as the environment, human rights, security, and their condition in different parts of the world. In examining development historically, we encourage students to situate trends shaping the twenty-first century world, and how they can contribute, as global citizens, to the ongoing debate about how to reformulate development as an inclusive an empowering social process.\nThis course combines Lectures with discussion, and uses films and section discussions to promote reflection on diversity of cultures and understandings of human development. It also includes a special component (access by instructor permission), in conjunction with Cornell's Writing in the Majors Program. This is worth an additional credit hour, and is for advanced students. These students will meet additionally in weekly Sections with a Writing Instructor from Development Sociology for a special topic focus to enhance understanding of course material as well as writing skills.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-SBY)","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Discuss

industrialism societies?  Is there a \"ruling class?\"  Are lifestyles, attitudes, and personalities shaped fundamentally by class membership?  Can individuals born into poverty readily escape their class origins and move upward in the class structure?  Are social contacts and \"luck\" important forces in matching individuals to jobs and class positions?  What types of social processes serve to

A key question is the extent to which the law creates and maintains social order. And, what is its role in social change? We will review theoretical perspectives on the reciprocal relationship between law and society, and consider how this relationship is reflected in contemporary legal issues. Empirical research covered in this course will examine social interactions among actors within legal institutions (including the criminal courts, law school classrooms, and the jury room), and how individuals experience and utilize the law in everyday life.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":354661,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"2650","titleShort":"Latinos In The USA","titleLong":"Latinos in the United States","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":5933,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":6,"netid":"hv13","firstName":"Hector","middleName":"","lastName":"Velez"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall G76-Lewis","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSHG76","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2655","type":"C"},{"subject":"DSOC","catalogNbr":"2650","type":"C"},{"subject":"LSP","catalogNbr":"2010","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Exploration and analysis of the Hispanic experience in the United States.

We will look at alternative medical practices and how they differ from and converge with the dominant medical paradigm. We will focus on the rise of medical technology in clinical practice with a special emphases on reproductive technologies. We will focus on the body as a site for medical knowledge, including the medicalization of sex differences, the effect of culture on nutrition, and eating disorders such as obesity and anorexia nervosa.

First, we'll read and discuss previous research on the health effects of social status, patient-physician interactions, employment/work, stress, social networks, social support, loneliness, culture and religion, and the neighborhood context. We'll consider both qualitative and quantitative research on social life and health, with an eye toward identifying the strengths and weaknesses of various methodological approaches and gaps in current knowledge. The second component of this course is focused on the development of your own research regarding the relationship between social context and health. You'll explore this using data from a population-based social survey. Class instruction for this portion of the course will cover research question development, the statistical analysis of survey data, and social scientific writing. Three research reports written during the semester will provide you with a foundation from which you will write and present a final paper that considers how health is shaped by the social world.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":361534,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"3190","titleShort":"Contemporary Soc.

Topics include user reviews, institutional audit, ranking and commensuration, algorithmic evaluation, tasting, gossip, and awards.

We then review several tools for diagnosing violations of statistical assumptions and what to do when things go wrong, including dealing with outliers, missing data, omitted variables, and weights. Finally, we will explore extensions of the linear regression model, including models for categorical outcomes and hierarchical linear modeling. While statistical modeling is the focus of the course, we proceed with the assumption that models are only as good as the theoretical and substantive knowledge behind them. Thus, in covering the technical material, we will spend considerable time discussing the link between substantive knowledge and statistical practice.
