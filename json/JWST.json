Rather than thinking of Judaism as static and easily definable, we will explore a history that is complex and dynamic. Over the three thousand year period that we will be studying, individuals and groups who identified themselves as Israelites or Jews developed a remarkable variety of beliefs and practices in conversation and in competition with other groups, including Christianity and Islam. We will examine trends and key moments of this process in order to understand how continuity and change, the construction of identity, and the competition for legitimacy have shaped our contemporary ideas about what Judaism is. We will approach this subject from a historical perspective, analyzing material evidence and reading texts from each period in translation, and from a religious studies perspective, carefully observing how the meaning of categories such as religion and Judaism change over time. A better understanding of these changes can help us better to appreciate difference and conflict both ancient and contemporary.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":357485,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"2674","titleShort":"Hist

We will begin with a survey of various forms of Bibli-cal and post-Biblical Second Temple writings. These texts will serve to establish the literary frameworks against which the rabbinic genres form. We will then explore the Mishanh, the Tosefta, and the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmuds. Through an exploration of the development of parallel themes, we will come to an understanding of how and when these texts evolved. Finally, we will explore a number of Midrashic compilations and assess their historical settings as well as their literary and ideological relationships to the two Talmuds.

Biblical notions of howling desert wastelands and subsequent ideas about deserts inhabited by terrifying and grotesque demons; paradise, a garden where angels' wings whir and pure light shines; valleys of rattling dry bones, sinews, and skins that breathe with new life; heavens clanging with the sound of war between seven-headed dragons and angels; demons coming in the forms of roaring lions and hissing serpents-the religious imaginary is shaped in striking ways by sensory landscapes. We will read widely from desert Christian monastic literatures, mostly from late ancient Egypt, to explore both the historical development of monasticism in Christianity and examine why the monastic impulse seems so closely tied to the \"desert.\" In addition to reading saints lives, we will read early monastic rules, the desert fathers, and we will draw from archaeological sources to examine the varieties of ascetic practices in the deserts of late ancient Egypt, Gaza, Sinai, Palestine, and Syria. Throughout the course we will explore ancient and modern ideas about \"wilderness\" and we will explore parallels between ancient Near Eastern literatures and their nineteenth- and twentieth-century parallels in the American frontier and environmental literatures.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":359446,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"4670","titleShort":"Wealth & Power","titleLong":"Wealth and Power: Political Economy in Ancient Near Eastern States","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15883,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:00PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"cmm253","firstName":"Christopher","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Monroe"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 156","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH156","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARKEO","catalogNbr":"4670","type":"C"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"4670","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Early states emerged when select groups gained control over wealth and power and institutionalized that control. How this was accomplished is a question of political economy that we can approach from archaeological, anthropological, and sociological perspectives. The course introduces students to the intellectual development of historical materialism in Smith, Marx, and Weber, among others, and traces their influence on later socioeconomic historians such as Polanyi and Finley. More recent approaches deriving from world-systems, gender studies, post-colonial studies, game theory, and network theory are then applied to case studies that include the emergence of a Mesopotamian state ca. 3400 BC, the Akkadian and Ur III empires, Old Babylonian and Old Assyrian trade, pharaonic Egypt, the international Late Bronze Age world, Aegean palatial civilization, and the Phoenicians. Students are welcome to present and write on other topics also.

The medieval period invented shocking fictions about Jews--that they killed and ate Christian babies; that they desecrated the Host; that they were the murderers of Christ. In manuscripts Jews were visually compared to beasts, devils, and perverts. By law, Jews were forced to live in ghettos, wear distinctive dress, abstain from certain professions, and suffer exile. Beginning with Shakespeare's Shylock, we will work our way back through visual and literary treatments of Jews in the Middle Ages, reading texts by Chaucer, chronicles, miracle stories, crusader romances, and mystery plays. Drawing on recent theories of the other we will also consider how medieval representations of Jews and other minorities were used to construct medieval communal, religious, and political identities.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":366574,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"6221","titleShort":"Judeo-Arabic","titleLong":"Judeo-Arabic","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16890,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rb23","firstName":"Ross","middleName":"","lastName":"Brann"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"6221","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar presents an introduction to Judeo-Arabic through the study of selected classical texts and the study of its grammar and lexicon.

The Bible itself will be the primary text for the course, but students will also be exposed to the rich and diverse textual traditions of the ancient Near East, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, Moab, and Ugarit. In addition, this course will explore the impact of early biblical interpretation on shaping the monotheistic traditions inherited in the West. As participants in a secular course on the Bible, students will be challenged to question certain cultural assumptions about the composition and authorship of the Bible, and will be expected to differentiate between a text's content and its presumed meaning.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":353533,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"3102","titleShort":"Advanced Modern Hebrew II","titleLong":"Advanced Modern Hebrew II","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":5637,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ns21","firstName":"Nava","middleName":"","lastName":"Scharf"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"White Hall 114","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT114","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For scheduling conflicts, contact instructor."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"3102","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course is a continuation of work done in NES 3101/JWST 3101, with less emphasis on the study of grammar.

actor in public spheres.  During those years, the Jewish intellectual becomes a privileged object of investigations, definitions and fantasies -- including anti-Semitic stereotypes -- for literature and popular culture, sociology and medicine or law, deeply shaping national mentalities and imagination.  A considerable iconography, from painting to political propaganda and illustrated magazines, sketches his real or invented profile.  As an incarnation of urbanity, mobility, extraterritoriality, textuality and rational thought, the Jewish intellectual turns out to be a mirror of modernity, eliciting a strong conservative rejection.  Lasting from the Dreyfus Affair to the Nazi burning of books in 1933, and focusing on three national contexts -- France, Germany and Italy -- the course tries to explore the history of this collective representation through its multiple expressions, both textual and visual.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with GERST 6231/HIST 6232/JWST 6230/ROMS

Referred to by the Arab media as \"1948 Arabs\" or \"Arabs within\" and by the Israeli media as \"Israeli Arabs\" or \"the Arab sector,\" this community is often overlooked in discussions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the peace process. In this seminar we will focus our attention on the history, experiences, and identity of this marginalized, and largely bilingual community. We will read and discuss a range of texts in Hebrew and Arabic by and about Palestinian-Israelis. Readings will include historical and sociological studies, journalism, and literature.

What is the Gospel of Judas and are its ideas \"heretical\"? Who wrote the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary and why were these Gospels not included in the New Testament canon? To what extent did Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code draw from ancient Christian gnostic sources? This seminar will explore answers to these questions and many others by focusing on the complex array of literary sources from late antiquity-primarily from a cache of manuscripts found at Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945-that have long been associated with a so-called \"Christian Gnosticism.\" Church Fathers condemned the \"movement\" on a variety of grounds, but in this course we will not simply read the condemnations written by the opponents of gnostic thought; rather, we will focus our attention on reading (in English translation) substantial portions of the \"gnostic\" texts written by the adherents themselves. We will give special attention to the ways in which conflicts about Gnosticism connected with conflicts about gender, heresy, power, and authority. To set these texts within a socio-historical context, we will discuss the possible Jewish and hellenistic roots of early Christian Gnosticism and ties to Stoic and other ancient philosophical movements.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366881,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"4776","titleShort":"Talmud and the Art of Reading","titleLong":"Talmud and the Art of Reading","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15656,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"zs283","firstName":"Zvi","middleName":"","lastName":"Septimus"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"White Hall 104","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT104","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"CLASS","catalogNbr":"4637","type":"C"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"4776","type":"C"},{"subject":"RELST","catalogNbr":"4776","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The Babylonian Talmud has long been viewed as the central text of post-Biblical Judaism. Yet little is known about who wrote it and when it was written. Since the Talmud is an extremely difficult text to master, its readership has therefore until recently been limited to few expert traditional scholars. Over the past fifty or so years, with the advent of translations and study guides, the Talmud has gained increasing popularity. The Talmud has long been viewed as a source for history, law, or moral lessons. But literature interacts with the cultures that produce and read it in far more nuanced and significant ways. In the past century, advances in theories of how and why to read literature have opened up new avenues for understanding what the Talmud says and, more importantly, how it works . This course will examine provocative, bizarre, and salacious Talmud passages through the lens of the evolution of the major theoretical schools of the past century. Each week we will explore a theoretical movement ( e.g. New Criticism, Formalism, Post-Stucturalism, Feminist Criticism, New Historicism , etc .) and apply their reading strategies to close readings of Talmud passages. We will simultaneously read the work of modern Talmud scholars whose reading practices align with each of these theoretical schools. All Texts will be read in translation and no previous knowledge of Talmud or Critical Theory is necessary.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366854,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"4913","titleShort":"Walter Benjamin","titleLong":"Walter Benjamin","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15879,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jab857","firstName":"Jonathan","middleName":"Aaron","lastName":"Boyarin"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"McGraw Hall B65","bldgDescr":"McGraw Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MCGB65","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"4413","type":"B"},{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"7413","type":"B"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4429","type":"B"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6429","type":"B"},{"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"4413","type":"B"},{"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"6413","type":"B"},{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"7913","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"4913","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"7913","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This extraordinary figure died in 1941, and his death is emblematic of the intellectual depradations of Nazism. Yet since World War II, his influence, his reputation, and his fascination for scholars in a wide range of cultural and political disciplines has steadily grown. He is seen as a bridging figure between German and Jewish studies, between materialist critique of culture and the submerged yet powerful voice of theology, between literary history and philosophy. We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with ANTHR 7413/JWST 7913/NES

actor in public spheres.  During those years, the Jewish intellectual becomes a privileged object of investigations, definitions and fantasies -- including anti-Semitic stereotypes -- for literature and popular culture, sociology and medicine or law, deeply shaping national mentalities and imagination.  A considerable iconography, from painting to political propaganda and illustrated magazines, sketches his real or invented profile.  As an incarnation of urbanity, mobility, extraterritoriality, textuality and rational thought, the Jewish intellectual turns out to be a mirror of modernity, eliciting a strong conservative rejection.  Lasting from the Dreyfus Affair to the Nazi burning of books in 1933, and focusing on three national contexts -- France, Germany and Italy -- the course tries to explore the history of this collective representation through its multiple expressions, both textual and visual.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with GERST 4231/HIST 4232/JWST 4230/ROMS

So too, American interests in the region, particularly the US close alliance with Saudi Arabia as well as Egypt and Jordan have undergone various transformations over the past two generations.

with church bells and calls from the minarets.   Music, chanting, recitations, incantations, mantras, gongs—the world of religion is intimately tied to ritualistic uses of sound.   But sound goes even beyond ritual to the realm of the imaginary, which frequently contrasts the music of the gods with the noise of the demons.   Sound and silence in such contexts are inherently tied to desire, temptation, and even salvation.  In addition, environmental sounds—the sounds of thunder, water, wind, animals, and so forth—are important for religious history and literature and contemporary practices.    This course will draw upon a wide array of sources—from texts to recordings, videos, and performances—to address the function and meaning of sound (and silence) within diverse religious traditions.   Our goal will be to read selections from the field of sound studies, listen and read closely in texts and music coming from diverse religious traditions, and to make some of our own recordings for a Cornell (and beyond) religious soundscape. ","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367351,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"4739","titleShort":"Animating

based on stories found in the Talmud to ask questions about interpretation, performance, authorship, and the role readers play in the production of pre-existing texts.  In what ways is a film director forced to view a text through a different lens than a reader?  What role does an actor play in the production of meaning in a linguistically static script?  In the process of reading a text, we produce visual images in our own minds.  These images are sometimes drawn to reflect textual cues provided by the author, but quite often are the result of subconscious interpretive acts, where we are forced to write in the space that the author left blank.  How can bringing this aspect of the interpretive process to the foreground help us understand what it is we do when we read?  How can learning to read a text through the eyes of an artist change the way we read; and how can reading itself be a productive form of art?  The Talmud presents its laconic narratives in a manner that encourages readers to partner in the act of its writing.  The Talmud's literary form, therefore, makes it an ideal text through which to examine the art of close reading.  (All Texts will be read in translation and no previous knowledge of Talmud is necessary.)","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":357464,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"4950","titleShort":"Cervantes:

a Madrid church in order to recover Miguel de Cervantes' remains.  This search is not fortuitous.  In 2015, the literary world celebrates the tetracentenary of Don Quixote II, a sequel to Don Quixote I (1605).  Constituted by two different works, connected magisterially by its author, Cervantes' masterpiece was hailed by philosopher Michel Foucault as \"the first modern work of literature.\"  In fact, Foucault claimed that Cervantes' discovery of the arbitrary relation of words and things ushered in the modern age.  Don Quixote begins with an erosion of the belief in the authority of the written word, an approach that anticipates postmodern thought.  A revolutionary document in its own age, Cervantes' novel confronts us with the complex history of Spain-the vexed relations among the Moorish, Jewish, and Christian cultures.  Our seminar will undertake an interdisciplinary reading of Don Quixote, using various theoretical approaches.  Cervantes' fascination with Islam, his cultural tolerance, and his display of humor make him a modern author.  In addition, his exploration of fantasy versus \"reality,\" and madness in relation to meaning, turn him into a forerunner of Freud.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Conducted in

Drawing on recent theories of the other we will also consider how medieval representations of Jews and other minorities were used to construct medieval communal, religious, and political identities.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367332,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"7520","titleShort":"Jewish Cities","titleLong":"Jewish Cities","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17819,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jab857","firstName":"Jonathan","middleName":"Aaron","lastName":"Boyarin"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 382","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH382","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"4620","type":"B"},{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"7620","type":"B"},{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"4520","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"4520","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"7520","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course at the intersection of studies in Jewish and urban culture draws on a wide range of textual and other evidence, from the Babylonian Talmud to contemporary American literature, to gain an understanding of how Jews have helped to shape and been shaped by their city neighbors.

We will examine trends and key moments of this process in order to understand how continuity and change, the construction of identity, and the competition for legitimacy have shaped our contemporary ideas about what Judaism is. We will approach this subject from a historical perspective, analyzing material evidence and reading texts from each period in translation, and from a religious studies perspective, carefully observing how the meaning of categories such as religion and Judaism change over time.

Despite its success in establishing the State of Israel in 1948, Zionism, which also sought to \"normalize\" Jewish collective life and provide a safe haven from persecution for the Jews, has encountered multiple challenges from within and without. Some continue to think of it as the national liberation movement of the Jewish people while others regard it is a Western inspired colonial project. Originating largely as a radical rejection of both traditional Jewish religious life and the Jews' diaspora in favor of modern nationalism, since 1967 Zionism has witnessed religious-nationalist fervor and a Jewish diaspora increasingly interested in or disinterested with the state of Israel. The course also considers the phenomenon of post-Zionism in Israeli historiography as well as Zionism's difficulty in coming to terms with the idea and reality that two peoples rather than one live in the land west of the Jordan.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":353554,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"4102","titleShort":"Biblical

immigration, United States industrialization, and processes of social and geographical mobility—all through the prism of New York's Lower East Side, first home for over 750,000 Jewish immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe, the Ottoman Empire and elsewhere between the mid-19th century and the 1920s.  We will compare the Jewish experience to that of other immigrants/migrants by considering social institutions as well as material and other cultural practices.

Thus many of the pivotal events which shaped western civilization were played out in the streets and structures of Jerusalem. This class will explore the history, archaeology, natural topography and role of Jerusalem throughout its long life, from its earliest remains in the Chalcolithic period (ca. 4000 B.C.E.) to the 19th century, including Jebusite Jerusalem, Jerusalem as the capital of the Davidic dynasty, the Roman era city of Herod and Jesus, the Crusaders and medieval Jerusalem, and Ottoman Jerusalem as the city entered the modern era. Students will examine the original historical sources (e.g. the Bible, Josephus, the Madeba map, etc.) which pertain to Jerusalem. PowerPoint lectures will be used to illustrate the natural features, man-made monuments, and artifacts which flesh out the textual material, providing a fuller image of the world's most prominent spiritual and secular capital.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":353524,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"2793","titleShort":"Middle Eastern Cinema","titleLong":"Middle Eastern Cinema","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16061,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"das86","firstName":"Deborah","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Starr"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"White Hall 110","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT110","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"2293","type":"C"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"2793","type":"C"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"2493","type":"C"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"2193","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Film industries in the Middle East, as in much of the rest of the world, emerged out of efforts at the national level. In the Arab world and Israel, the film industries reflect upon struggles of self-determination. The Iranian film industry underwent significant changes following the Islamic Revolution of 1979. By viewing a range of films from the Arab world, including North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as from Turkey, Israel, and Iran, we will consider the significance of these national rubrics and how they have shaped the work of filmmakers throughout the Middle East.   Films also reach beyond the boundaries of the nation, and so, we will consider how these films transcend national borders. On the one hand we will consider limit factors, like censorship, and the role of language and dialect on film viewership and distribution. And, on the other hand, we will consider the influence of external forces, such as the influence of foreign film markets in Europe and North America on filmmakers in the Middle East, as well as the effects of foreign financing—both from Europe and the Gulf States.  All films will be screened with English subtitles.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":353532,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"3101","titleShort":"Advanced Modern Hebrew I","titleLong":"Advanced Modern Hebrew I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":6415,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"ns21","firstName":"Nava","middleName":"","lastName":"Scharf"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"White Hall 114","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT114","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For scheduling conflicts, contact instructor."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"3101","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Successful completion of NES 3101 fulfills Option 1 language requirement.

Originating from present-day Lebanon, they were Semitic speakers, renowned seafarers and transmitters of an innovative alphabet that transformed how Mediterranean and Near Eastern folk wrote their languages. Having left us virtually no texts of their own, their history has resembled a patchwork of recollections from Old Testament and Hellenistic times. Recent archaeological discoveries, however, reveal patterns of trade, colonization and socioeconomic transformations that make the Phoenicians less enigmatic while raising new questions. Our class explores the third and second millennium Canaanite roots of the Phoenicians, as well as the Biblical and Greco-Roman perceptions of their early first millennium heyday. We will explore the Phoenician homeland and its colonies, and investigate their maritime economy, language, and religion through both archaeological and textual sources. Temporally the focus is on Phoenician rather than Carthaginian or Punic history, thus up to about 550 BCE. The class has a seminar format involving critical discussions and presentations of scholarly readings, and requires a research paper.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368658,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"4623","titleShort":"Ethnic & Religious Minorities","titleLong":"Ethnic and Religious Minorities in the Middle East (1800-1950)","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17348,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mm2492","firstName":"Mostafa","middleName":"","lastName":"Minawi"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 254","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH254","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"4546","type":"W"},{"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"6546","type":"W"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"4623","type":"W"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"6623","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar utilizes recent research on the concept of minorities in the Middle East during the late Ottoman Period, through the age of European colonialism, and post-colonial nationalisms.  Following a case-study approach and relying on new research, we will focuses on the social and political histories of Armenians, Jews, Kurds, Greek Orthodox, Catholic, and non-Sunni Muslims in the Middle East.

We will examine trends and key moments of this process in order to understand how continuity and change, the construction of identity, and the competition for legitimacy have shaped our contemporary ideas about what Judaism is. We will approach this subject from a historical perspective, analyzing material evidence and reading texts from each period in translation, and from a religious studies perspective, carefully observing how the meaning of categories such as religion and Judaism change over time.
