It starts with the alphabet and the number system and builds the four skills gradually and systematically through carefully selected and organized materials focusing on specific, concrete and familiar topics such as self identification, family, travel, food, renting an apartment, study, the weather, etc.). These topics are listed in the textbook's table of contents.  The student who successfully completes the two-course sequence will have mastered about 1000 basic words and will be able to: 1) understand and actively participate in conversations on a limited range of practical topics such as self-identification, family, school, work, the weather, travel, etc., 2) read and understand, with the help of a short list of words, passages of up to 180 words written in Arabic script, and 3) discuss orally in class and write a 50-word paragraph in Arabic.  The two-course sequence aims to take the student from the Novice to the Intermediate Mid level according to the ACTFL proficiency

How did its native inhabitants fared in the aftermath of the arrival of Europeans? How did the region shift from a Spanish Lake to a heavily contested geopolitical site where all European powers vied for political and commercial superiority? What were the main production systems of the region and how did they result in dramatic environmental change? How did the eighteenth-century revolutions transform the Caribbean? In this introductory survey to Caribbean history we will answer these and many other questions through the study of the political, economic, social, cultural, and environmental transformations of the Caribbean from the arrival of Columbus to the era of the Haitian Revolution. We will follow indigenous people, Spanish conquistadors, English, Dutch, and French pirates and privateers, planters, and merchants, imperial officers, slaves, sailors, and revolutionaries as they adapted to the multiple transformations that shaped this region. Through lectures, discussions, and readings of primary and secondary sources we will navigate the Caribbean in a quest to understand the historical processes that gave shape to this tropical paradise.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":363967,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"1822","titleShort":"FWS: AF American Short Story","titleLong":"FWS: The African American Short Story","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17425,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rdr83","firstName":"Riche","middleName":"D.","lastName":"Richardson"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 331","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH331","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-Year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"FWS Session"}],"description":"The short story is an ideal genre through which one might gain a basic introduction to African American literature and its major themes. As a form and genre, the short story's specific origins within African American literature are traceable back to the antebellum era of the nineteenth century. The genre was significantly advanced in the post-bellum era by authors such as Charles Chesnutt, thrived throughout the twentieth century, and continues to develop in contemporary African American literature. In this course, we will consider short stories by Chesnutt, Jessie Fauset, Nella Larsen, Arna Bontemps, Zora Neale Hurston, Ralph Ellison, Langston Hughes, James Baldwin, Ann Petry, Rosa Guy, Paule Marshall, Ernest J. Gaines, and Toni Morrison. The primary goal of this course as a First-Year Writing Seminar is to reinforce the skills of students in good and effective writing. Through weekly entries in a reading journal, the production of six papers, including several of which will be revised, and periodic in-class writing exercises, students will produce an extensive portfolio of written materials over the course of the semester. This course is designed to give students one of the strongest possible foundations upon which to build for success as writers in the years at Cornell and beyond.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368675,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"1830","titleShort":"FWS: Black Expatriate Writing","titleLong":"FWS: Black Expatriate Writing","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17635,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall G20","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URHG20","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-Year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"FWS Session"}],"description":"We will examine the phenomenon of the global dimensions of post-World War II African American struggles for equality through the writings of black expatriates in Europe and Africa, and the international presence of black performing artists and intellectuals, as well.

injustice constructed around race, class, and food in the United States. Students think critically about real-world problems related to food access and security while studying three intersecting, yet countering U.S. food movements: corporate industrial agriculture, local food, and food justice, that impact the way food is produced, distributed, and consumed. We pay particular attention to efforts in these food movements that mitigate and exacerbate race and class-based inequalities within the social, cultural, economic, and political contexts of the U.S. food system.  Our exploration of food (in)justice relies on the idea that the U.S. food system is what Omi and Winant (1994) call a racial project—political and economic undertakings through which racial hierarchies are established and racialized subjectivities are created.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":351008,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"1900","titleShort":"Research Strategies","titleLong":"Research Strategies in Africana and Latino Studies","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15422,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"03:20PM","startDt":"03/20/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"ajc5","firstName":"Anthony","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Cosgrave"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Uris Library B05","bldgDescr":"Uris Library","facilityDescrshort":"URLB05","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"03/20/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"LSP","catalogNbr":"1101","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"03/20/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"002","classNbr":15438,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"03/20/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"ea18","firstName":"Eric","middleName":"","lastName":"Acree"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Olin Library 106G","bldgDescr":"Olin Library","facilityDescrshort":"OLL106G","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"03/20/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"LSP","catalogNbr":"1101","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"03/20/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"}],"description":"The digital revolution has made an enormous amount of information available to research scholars, but discovering resources and using them effectively can be challenging.

Students are assigned communicative tasks such as respond to a situation with a short text and take part in a discussion after viewing short video clips and prompts to elicit speaking and listening competence and cultural awareness responses beyond elementary level. The language and cultural scenarios practiced are designed to help students demonstrate language responses beyond familiar topics, and to feel comfortable conversing with Swahili native speakers, as well as to blend in and feel welcomed as part of the community while exploring different topics such as acquaintanceship, relationships, health, festivals, education, sports, housing, politics, commerce, travel, etc. Short stories are used to depict cultural aspects such as cultural expressions, proverbs, sayings, and riddles. Literature and cultural materials are incorporated into the course, along with audio-visual and web-based material.

Hipster Brooklyn. Immigrant Brooklyn. Brownstone Brooklyn. This course borrows from hip hop's notion of \"representing\" to explore popular and cultural understandings of race and place in Brooklyn as depicted in print, music, film, and online. How is Brooklyn represented? Who represents Brooklyn? What do these representations reveal about Black cultural production, inequality, and identity formation more broadly speaking? While today Brooklyn is New York City's hippest borough and the site of swift gentrification, booming real estate, and the ever-escalating displacement of immigrant and Black communities, in the 1980s and 1990s it was a hotbed of hip hop music, making the borough synonymous with Black cultural production. Now a \"global brand,\" New York's most populous borough is still the home of the nation's most concentrated Black population. The course examines Black cultural production as it relates to representations of Brooklyn. It also deconstructs images and discourses that marginalize the borough's Black residents. Spanning the period from 1945 to the present day, emphases will include the grassroots movements of the 1960s-1970s, the commodification of hip hop in the 1980s-1990s, and close readings of films including Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing,\" to reflect on how Black popular culture engages with Brooklyn's diverse communities. While materials are interdisciplinary in approach, our investigation is informed by anthropological, historical, and literary texts covering topics including immigration, youth culture, transnationalism, gentrification, authenticity, and classed, gendered and racialized inequality.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":353536,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"3101","titleShort":"Advanced Arabic II","titleLong":"Advanced Arabic II","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":7807,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":11,"netid":"mgw49","firstName":"Makda","middleName":"G.","lastName":"Weatherspoon"}],"pattern":"MTWR","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall G20","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSHG20","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"3202","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"In this two-semester sequence, learners will be introduced to authentic, unedited Arabic language materials ranging from short stories, and poems, to newspaper articles dealing with social,  political,  and cultural issues.

This course is not intended to settle that question as is currently formulated. Instead, the course approaches the question of intervention in Libya in terms of the connections between global governance, the responsibility to protect, and political order and democracy in the zones of intervention. In this context, the course has two aims. The first is to contrast the approach of the African Union to the resolution of the Libyan crisis, which was summarily dismissed by the US and its allies, with the preferred approach of the Permanent Western members of the UN Security Council.  The second aim is to examine the manner in which the responsibility to protect was executed in Libya and the lessons that might be gained from it. ","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368563,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"3330","titleShort":"Is China Recolonizing Africa?","titleLong":"Is China Recolonizing Africa?","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16499,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sng52","firstName":"Siba","middleName":"N'Zatioula","lastName":"Grovogui"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 204","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH204","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"3333","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"One key question about China's rise as an economic power has been what it does or is doing around the world.

This course is not about the benefits the concentration of investments in natural resources.

the John Henrik Clarke Library.  It is interdisciplinary and comparative in orientation and incorporates community outreach and service.  The April 19, 1969 incident known as \"the Willard Straight Takeover\" occurred during Parents' Weekend when black students occupied the student union on campus and, when threatened, returned with firearms in self-defense and also advocated for an Africana center to be developed.  When the takeover ended, the students were photographed by Steve Starr as they exited with their firearms.  The image won a Pulitzer Prize and has become iconic and world-famous.  This protest, which one of its most vocal critics has identified as a catalyst for the nation's \"culture wars,\" is one of the most important events in the history of Cornell University, even if the memory has been deeply unsettling for some.  Yet, even after nearly fifty years have passed, this event remains misunderstood, and its facts are sometimes grossly distorted or exaggerated.  Even worse, sometimes this history has been forgotten or else routinely omitted from major histories and timelines at Cornell.  In all of these respects, it is absolutely crucial to set the record straight.  The topic of the Willard Straight Takeover is one of great interest and fascination among many students.  The main goal in developing this course is to make a scholarly framework available in which they might expand and reinforce their knowledge of this topic, for so many students are curious about this history.  Black women were central in the development of this student movement from its inception, a role that is frequently discussed in relation to the incident with black female students at Wari House.  One of the goals of the course is to highlight the crucial contributions of women to the Willard Straight Takeover, which have sometimes been overlooked.  This background underscores that there is no one history or narrative of the Willard Straight Takeover incident, but many overlapping histories, and that gender, race, and class have been central factors in constituting them.  Architecture, even, past and present, plays a central role in shaping perceptions of and myths about this event.  Given the importance of outreach, building coalitions and supporting a range of peer fields on campus, this course will also serve as a vital context for reinforcing knowledge of the Latino Day Hall Takeover in 1993 during the Thanksgiving Break, which occurred to discuss the possibility for creating a Latino Living Center and a Latino Studies Program.  An important aspect as we proceed will be investigating the black student movement in national and global perspective and its relation to the civil rights and Black Power movement, from San Francisco State to Jackson State and beyond.  Our campus libraries, including the John Henrik Clark Library at the Africana Center, hold a wealth of resources in a range of genres related to this incident, including films and videos, essays, photographs, interviews, and articles.  Students will explore these materials as a way of gaining a basic historical introduction to this incident.  In the process, they will reinforce their skills for analyzing and interpreting various media and archival materials.  An added benefit of this course it that it is also designed to reinforce skills that they are building in a diverse range of academic coursework, along with their technological literacies.  This course honors and pays tribute to the history and meaning of the Willard Straight Takeover in 1969 as an event that was not only about Cornell, but also drew in the Ithaca community.  A priority will be to facilitate the development of student projects and community outreach initiatives.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":364578,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"4291","titleShort":"Marriage

The institution was an important marker of adulthood, linking individuals and lineages in a network of mutual cooperation and support. Marriage practices and the concomitant gender expectations varied significantly between societies, and over time. As a result, marriage and divorce are especially rich terrain for exploring social history, women's agency, discursive constructions of 'women', masculinity and gender relations of power. This course explores some of the newest scholarship on marriage by Africanist scholars. The readings demonstrate the wide cultural variety in marriage as well as the dynamic relationship between marriage and historical change. They especially highlight women's roles and expectations in marriage, masculinity and the ways men and women negotiated the rules and boundaries of marriage.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368573,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"4310","titleShort":"Engaging NYC","titleLong":"Engaging NYC: Oral History and Ethnography","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16508,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:35PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ol43","firstName":"Oneka","middleName":"","lastName":"LaBennett"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Africana Ctr B01","bldgDescr":"Africana Ctr","facilityDescrshort":"AFCB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4410","type":"C"},{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"6410","type":"C"},{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"4711","type":"C"},{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"7711","type":"C"},{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"6310","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This engaged-learning course offers students a unique chance to gain valuable experience collaborating with a social justice organization in New York City.

This course, grounded in science fiction, will address this question via the thoughtful examination of a range of theoretical, fictional, and cinematic texts.

the John Henrik Clarke Library.  It is interdisciplinary and comparative in orientation and incorporates community outreach and service.  The April 19, 1969 incident known as \"the Willard Straight Takeover\" occurred during Parents' Weekend when black students occupied the student union on campus and, when threatened, returned with firearms in self-defense and also advocated for an Africana center to be developed.  When the takeover ended, the students were photographed by Steve Starr as they exited with their firearms.  The image won a Pulitzer Prize and has become iconic and world-famous.  This protest, which one of its most vocal critics has identified as a catalyst for the nation's \"culture wars,\" is one of the most important events in the history of Cornell University, even if the memory has been deeply unsettling for some.  Yet, even after nearly fifty years have passed, this event remains misunderstood, and its facts are sometimes grossly distorted or exaggerated.  Even worse, sometimes this history has been forgotten or else routinely omitted from major histories and timelines at Cornell.  In all of these respects, it is absolutely crucial to set the record straight.  The topic of the Willard Straight Takeover is one of great interest and fascination among many students.  The main goal in developing this course is to make a scholarly framework available in which they might expand and reinforce their knowledge of this topic, for so many students are curious about this history.  Black women were central in the development of this student movement from its inception, a role that is frequently discussed in relation to the incident with black female students at Wari House.  One of the goals of the course is to highlight the crucial contributions of women to the Willard Straight Takeover, which have sometimes been overlooked.  This background underscores that there is no one history or narrative of the Willard Straight Takeover incident, but many overlapping histories, and that gender, race, and class have been central factors in constituting them.  Architecture, even, past and present, plays a central role in shaping perceptions of and myths about this event.  Given the importance of outreach, building coalitions and supporting a range of peer fields on campus, this course will also serve as a vital context for reinforcing knowledge of the Latino Day Hall Takeover in 1993 during the Thanksgiving Break, which occurred to discuss the possibility for creating a Latino Living Center and a Latino Studies Program.  An important aspect as we proceed will be investigating the black student movement in national and global perspective and its relation to the civil rights and Black Power movement, from San Francisco State to Jackson State and beyond.  Our campus libraries, including the John Henrik Clark Library at the Africana Center, hold a wealth of resources in a range of genres related to this incident, including films and videos, essays, photographs, interviews, and articles.  Students will explore these materials as a way of gaining a basic historical introduction to this incident.  In the process, they will reinforce their skills for analyzing and interpreting various media and archival materials.  An added benefit of this course it that it is also designed to reinforce skills that they are building in a diverse range of academic coursework, along with their technological literacies.  This course honors and pays tribute to the history and meaning of the Willard Straight Takeover in 1969 as an event that was not only about Cornell, but also drew in the Ithaca community.  A priority will be to facilitate the development of student projects and community outreach initiatives.  ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368663,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"6131","titleShort":"A

work emerging about the Greater Caribbean in the context of Latin America, the African Diaspora, Atlantic History, Global History, comparative emancipation from chattel slavery, and the study of global revolution.  Students will make in-class presentations that locate these titles in a deeper historiography with classic texts.  This course crosses imperial boundaries of archives and historiography, in order to consider the intersecting allegiances, identities, itineraries, and diaspora of peoples, in local, hemispheric, and global context. Some central questions include: What is the lived geography of the Caribbean at different moments, and how does using different geographic and temporal frameworks help approach the region's history? What role did people living in this amorphously demarcated region play in major historical transformations of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries? How did the varied, but interconnected processes of Caribbean emancipation impact economic and political systems throughout the Atlantic and beyond? The course will conclude with a mini conference in which students of both universities will come together to discuss the state of the field and future directions in Caribbean history.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368572,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"6220","titleShort":"Modern Afr Political Philosoph","titleLong":"Modern African Political Philosophy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16504,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ot48","firstName":"Olufemi","middleName":"","lastName":"Taiwo"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Africana Ctr B07","bldgDescr":"Africana Ctr","facilityDescrshort":"AFCB07","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"PHIL","catalogNbr":"6461","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"What would happen if, instead of taking an instrumentalist view of the ideas of modern African political thinkers, we consider those ideas as indeed they are, attempts by them to proffer answers to the central questions of political philosophy as those are apprehended in the African context?

African countries promoted educational expansion with the expectation that it would lead to socio-economic development. The initial euphoria, however, was followed by skepticism and then disillusion.  Education, as it was being organized, delivered, received, and utilized, began to be perceived even as a hindrance to development. The course examines the relationship between formal education and individual and national development. Different paradigms of development, including modernization and dependency theories, and Third World Forum, are discussed with an emphasis on the perceived and actual roles of education in individual and national development. The issues to be discussed include education and schooling, the role of primary, secondary, and higher education in development, the problems of employment, language, equity in access and results with a focus on gender, race, and social class. Case studies, including selected countries of the different African sub-regions, will be used for illustration.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":366205,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"6602","titleShort":"Women &Gender Issues in Africa","titleLong":"Women and Gender Issues in Africa","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":8805,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"na12","firstName":"N'Dri","middleName":"Therese","lastName":"Assie-Lumumba"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Africana Ctr B07","bldgDescr":"Africana Ctr","facilityDescrshort":"AFCB07","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"4602","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"There are two contrasting views of the status and role of women in Africa. One view portrays African women as controlled by men in all social institutions. Another view projects women as having a relatively favorable position in indigenous societies they were active with an identity independent of men's and no concentration of women in a private sphere while men controlled the public sphere. This course examines critical gender theories and women in historical and contemporary periods. The topics covered include: non-westernized/pre-colonial societies; the impact and legacy of colonial policies; access to education and knowledge; women in politics and the economy in local and global contexts; women's organizations; armed conflicts and peace; same gender love and evolving family values; the law and health challenges; the United Nations and World Conferences on Women: Mexico 1975, Copenhagen 1980, Nairobi 1985, Beijing 1995 and post-Beijing meetings, and the 2010 superstructure of UN Women.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":351121,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"6901","titleShort":"Independent
