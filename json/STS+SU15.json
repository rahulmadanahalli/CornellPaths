The course explores classic and contemporary science fiction from Frankenstein to The Hunger Games alongside a rich array of fiction, films, and new media from Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Our discussions will position these works vis-à-vis seminal thinkers, ranging from Plato to Descartes and Donna Haraway to Paul Crutzen, who ask the same questions as science fiction does about ourselves, our world, and our future.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, summer.","catalogComments":"A University Course.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2594,"crseId":355099,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"STS","catalogNbr":"2871","titleShort":"Evolution","titleLong":"Evolution","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1156,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"06:00PM","timeEnd":"09:00PM","startDt":"06/22/2015","endDt":"07/31/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"adm6","firstName":"Allen","middleName":"Donald","lastName":"MacNeill"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Kennedy Hall 101","bldgDescr":"Kennedy Hall","facilityDescrshort":"KND101","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.
