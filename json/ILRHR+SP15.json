The purpose of this course is to introduce you to current theory, research, and practice regarding discrimination and inclusion in the workplace.Â  We will begin by defining diversity and the multiple existing justifications for \"managing diversity\" within organizations. We will then examine bias within organizations, including its root cause in stereotyping and power differentials, and its manifestation in the implementation of HR practices, the treatment of employees, and in broader society. We will also explore the impact of demographic diversity on the functioning of work groups/teams, particularly as it relates to commonly made arguments about the \"business case\" for diversity.Â  We will spend some time discussing the role of HR and diversity practices in fostering inclusion, and the important role of an organization's climate and culture.
