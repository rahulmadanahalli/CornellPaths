Stories and vignettes will provide background on the current university and its administrative structure, campus traditions, and the names that adorn buildings and memorials throughout campus. Finally, the course will offer a forum for students to address questions on present-day aspects of the university.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":350303,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2020","titleShort":"Pop Cult in US, 1950-Present","titleLong":"Popular Culture in the United States, 1950 to the Present","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16574,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"gca1","firstName":"Glenn","middleName":"C.","lastName":"Altschuler"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall G76-Lewis","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSHG76","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"201","classNbr":16868,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"White Hall 110","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT110","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"202","classNbr":16869,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"White Hall 110","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT110","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"203","classNbr":16870,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:00AM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"White Hall 110","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT110","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"204","classNbr":16872,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:00AM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"White Hall 110","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT110","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC","DIS"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course treats the period from 1950 to the present as we examine best-sellers, films, sports and television, radio, ads, newspapers, magazines, and music.

We will also attend to connections between popular music and anti-racist movements abroad, and assess the role of the popular music industry, radio, television and other mass media in aiding or abetting movements for social change.  We will also examine the global circulation and influence of American and African American popular music and culture.   Students will gain a basic knowledge of the main social political, and intellectual issues, concepts, social movements, and transformations of twentieth and twenty-first century African American and global history. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":364909,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2560","titleShort":"Waiting for Superman?","titleLong":"Waiting for Superman?

Under our very noses, however, Native American history has evolved into one of the most exciting, dynamic, and contentious fields of inquiry into America's past. It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to \"unlearn\" about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting. As such, the course will provide numerous opportunities for students to develop their critical thinking and reading skills.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":365237,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2682","titleShort":"U.S. in 1960s and 1970s","titleLong":"The United States in the 1960s and 1970s","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17293,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:00AM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jkh224","firstName":"Julilly","middleName":"","lastName":"Kohler-Hausmann"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Mcgraw Hall 165","bldgDescr":"McGraw Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MCG165","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"201","classNbr":17294,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 156","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH156","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"202","classNbr":17295,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"McGraw Hall 365","bldgDescr":"McGraw Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MCG365","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"203","classNbr":17556,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"McGraw Hall 366","bldgDescr":"McGraw Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MCG366","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"204","classNbr":17557,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 350","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH350","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC","DIS"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"2680","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This lecture course explores the dramatic cultural, economic, and social upheavals in U.S. society during the 1960s and 1970s.

Some theoretical works will be used, but most of our theoretical explorations will be inductively derived, from studies of actual movements and the difficulties they faced.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":365970,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3022","titleShort":"Capitalism&American Democracy","titleLong":"Capitalism and American Democracy: 1880-2010","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17568,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"nas4","firstName":"Nick","middleName":"","lastName":"Salvatore"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 217","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS217","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"3022","type":"C"},{"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"3022","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course explores the changing relationship between democratic practice and the evolving corporate form of capitalism during the late 19th and 20th centuries.

This course begins in the late nineteenth century, defining it as a pivotal moment in U.S. immigration and labor history when efforts to regulate immigrant entry and naturalization became increasingly bureaucratized. As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective. We will also address questions regarding the perceived benefit and cost of immigration at both the national and local (i.e., community) levels. In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time. Finally, we will consider how immigrants have negotiated the pressures of their new surroundings, and challenged dominant conceptions of American national identity and citizenship in the process.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":362619,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3131","titleShort":"Nature Functions Limits of Law","titleLong":"The Nature, Functions, and Limits of Law","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17287,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dmc66","firstName":"Dawn","middleName":"Michelle","lastName":"Chutkow"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 184","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH184","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"3131","type":"C"},{"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"4131","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"A general-education course to acquaint students with how our legal system pursues the goals of society.

We will explore the disparate cultural, national, historical and intellectual contexts in which Black identities are constructed, revealing both commonalities and differences. Paying specific attention to how racial identity is shaped by social context, the course will interrogate theories of Black identity formation and notions of Black nationhood, and will examine different perspectives on Diaspora theory. While readings are interdisciplinary in approach, our understandings of Blacks in the Atlantic world will be informed by ethnographic, historical and literary texts covering many cultural contexts including the U.S., England, Kenya, South Africa, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.

The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? Does hip hop allow a space for alternative femininities?

Finally, what are the broader theoretical implications of connections and divergences amongst various hemispheric articulations of black subjectivity?","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":358029,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"6656","titleShort":"Topics Social & Political Phil","titleLong":"Topics in Social and Political Philosophy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16688,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"rwm5","firstName":"Richard","middleName":"William","lastName":"Miller"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Stimson Hall 206","bldgDescr":"Stimson Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STM206","meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Inequalities: Economic, Political, Social,& Racial"}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4655","type":"B"},{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"4655","type":"B"},{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"6656","type":"B"},{"subject":"PHIL","catalogNbr":"4470","type":"B"},{"subject":"PHIL","catalogNbr":"6430","type":"B"},{"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"4430","type":"B"},{"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"6430","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Advanced discussion of a topic in social and political philosophy.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":365234,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"6670","titleShort":"Indian Country in Law & Lit","titleLong":"The Construction of Indian Country in Law and Literature","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16061,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"etc7","firstName":"Eric","middleName":"T.","lastName":"Cheyfitz"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Stimson Hall 105","bldgDescr":"Stimson Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STM105","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AIS","catalogNbr":"6670","type":"C"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"6670","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course analyzes the historical development of U.S. federal Indian law and its relation to American Indian literatures as a critical commentary on that law. As such, the course is generative for an understanding of (post)colonialism in the United States. We will study case law dealing with  issues in the ongoing history of federal Indian law, which include sovereignty; criminal and civil jurisdiction; religious, cultural, and civil rights; and the legal parameters of Indian identity. Along with the case law, we will read literary, political, historical, ethnographic texts that will help us understand the fundamental cultural and political conflicts between Indians and Europeans embedded in the law, between kinship-based societies sharing communal land, and a society based in the twin structures of individualism and property.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":364365,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"6761","titleShort":"Art & Social Histories","titleLong":"Art and Social Histories","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16900,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"llm4","firstName":"Laura","middleName":"Lee","lastName":"Meixner"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 156","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH156","meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Mass Culture in the Great Depression"}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4306","type":"B"},{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"4761","type":"B"},{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"6761","type":"B"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4761","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Seminar topics rotate each semester.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Auditing not permitted.
