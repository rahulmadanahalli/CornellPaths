This course evaluates claims about the strengths and limitations of the contemporary American jury. We will examine the image of the jury in popular culture, then explore the work of lawyers, legal scholars, psychologists, and other social scientists who have studied the jury in depth. Questions we'll address during the course include: Do juries represent all segments of their communities? Can lawyers stack a jury in their favor? Are jurors influenced by the \"CSI effect?\" What should judges do about googling and tweeting jurors? How do jurors use trial evidence and legal rules to decide on verdicts, damage awards, or decisions to sentence a defendant to death? By the course's end, students should be able to reach their own informed judgment about this perennially controversial institution.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: undergraduates only.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":351446,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"5001","titleShort":"Civil Procedure","titleLong":"Civil Procedure","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17827,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"03:25PM","startDt":"08/27/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"kmc12","firstName":"Kevin","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Clermont"}],"pattern":"TWR","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 184","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH184","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/27/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"002","classNbr":17828,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:10PM","startDt":"08/27/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"bjh12","firstName":"Barbara","middleName":"Jean","lastName":"Holden-Smith"}],"pattern":"TWR","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall G90","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTHG90","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/27/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"An introduction to civil litigation, from commencement of an action through disposition on appeal, studied in the context of the federal procedural system.

presentations. Assignments are usually set in the context of a simulated law office (or judge's chambers). In the fall semester, students write predictive memoranda that point out the strengths and weaknesses of their client's case. To prepare the memoranda, students may need to determine the facts of the case by conducting interviews or depositions. Acting as junior attorneys, students will also make an oral presentation to a supervising attorney. The spring semester focuses on persuasive advocacy. Students prepare a memorandum, motion, or brief for submission to a court and, later, orally argue for their positions in a simulated court session. Throughout the year, students also learn the fundamentals of legal research. Instruction occurs not only in full-class sessions but also in individual conferences. Students receive extensive feedback on each major assignment.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.

These concerns arise sharply in the context of the inclusion of social and economic rights in a constitution that is to be interpreted and enforced by the courts. Is the enforcement of these rights by courts undemocratic? Does the inclusion of these rights in a constitution force courts to violate the principle of the separation of powers because in the course of adjudicating on these rights courts are invariably required to make decisions that have implications for the allocation of resources and the formulation of policy? Do courts have the institutional competence to make decisions that are polycentric in nature? To lay foundation for exploring these concerns, the seminar will consider (a) the foundation of social and economic rights; (b) the emergence of the international regime on social and economic rights; and (c) various methods use in national legal systems to protect social and economic rights. The debate on the role of the judiciary in the enforcement of social and economic rights will be explored in the light of judicial experiences in countries such as India, South Africa, United States and Northern Ireland.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Limited enrollment.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":366067,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7440","titleShort":"Law and Social Change","titleLong":"Law and Social Change: Comparative Law in Africa","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18070,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"08/27/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"cgb28","firstName":"Cynthia","middleName":"G.","lastName":"Bowman"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mbn5","firstName":"Muna","middleName":"B.","lastName":"Ndulo"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall G81","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTHG81","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/27/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":null,"catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":364077,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7572","titleShort":"Litigation Drafting","titleLong":"Litigation Drafting","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18071,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"08/27/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lgf28","firstName":"Lara","middleName":"G.","lastName":"Freed"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 182","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH182","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/27/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course focuses on drafting documents typically encountered during the pretrial phase of civil litigation.

The legal issues both within the military and surrounding our military actions have risen to the forefront throughout the course of these conflicts. This seminar will explore those issues, taking a historical perspective on the evolution of the law as it intersects with the military while primarily focusing on the legal issues facing our country today. Topics will include a discussion of the military court-martial system as compared to the Article III civilian federal court system and the use of courts-martial to try non-military contractors employed in war environments. We will also examine the use of targeted killings and the detention of individuals in combat, including scrutiny of the developing case law regarding habeas rights for individuals the military has detained and the use of military commissions. This course is designed to elicit discussion from both a policy and legal perspective on these current issues while helping to broaden the students' understanding of how law impacts our military forces and how our military can be used to spread the Rule of Law. The course content will touch upon issues raised in criminal law, international law, national security law and the law of armed conflict. Students will be graded on two papers and their participation in classroom discussion.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the writing requirement.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":362855,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7631","titleShort":"Pretrial Pract., Lit.

The primary research vehicle is an operational website, RegRoom.org, which features live public commenting moderated by Clinic students.

Through a critical seminar and practical case and project work, students will examine and engage in local, global, and transnational efforts to combat gender violence and discrimination. Students will develop skills such as interviewing, fact-finding, project and case management, international and comparative legal research, legal drafting, and oral advocacy by working on projects and cases for human rights organizations, judges, intergovernmental human rights experts or bodies, and individuals. The course will give students hands-on experience in diverse methods of human rights advocacy, including fact-finding and reporting, legal assistance and counseling, domestic and international litigation, and human rights education. Project work focuses on issues related to gender justice such as: domestic violence; so-called \"honor\" crimes, gender violence in schools, prisons or other institutional settings; gender and HIV/AIDS; sexual offenses in armed conflict; child marriage; violations of women's property and inheritance rights; and trafficking in persons. Students will also have the opportunity to examine critically the ethical, political, cultural, and other challenges that affect the promotion of global gender justice. Some projects may involve optional domestic or international travel, and some projects may address gender justice issues within the United States. Students who wish to apply to the clinic should pre-register and also submit a resume, transcript, and statement of interest to Prof. Brundige (eb456@cornell.edu) by the end of the pre-registration period.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Limited enrollment.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":366875,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7915","titleShort":"Adv.
