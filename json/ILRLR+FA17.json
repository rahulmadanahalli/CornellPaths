It helps you to answer these questions: What is capitalism? Is the U.S. more capitalist than other countries? How has capitalism shaped the history of the United States?

We begin by reviewing the conditions of post-industrial labor in an era of declining unionization and weak federal and state protections. Next we review theories of legal consciousness and legal mobilization, which help explain the conditions under which low-wage workers learn about their rights and come forward to demand justice.  We walk through claimsmaking in an array of federal and state administrative bureaucracies, including wage and hour, health and safety, and discrimination.  We also look at how the immigration enforcement regime intersects with the tenets of at-will employment to grant employers wide latitude in retaliating against undocumented workers and stifling attempts at legal mobilization.  We next assess how these formal protections are filtered through various institutional gatekeepers (including legal advocates and medical experts) and how organizational compliance structures (such as human resources and mediation programs) have limited worker¿s ability to make claims on their rights.  We consider how intersecting bases of inequality (such as gender, race, and national origin) are processed by administrative bureaucracies, and how lay versus legal conceptions of workplace justice often diverge.  We end by considering the fallout of workplace abuse on individuals and their families.\t\r\n\r\nThis course fulfills the ILR Advanced Writing requirement.

The readings, combined with guest lectures by the authors, introduce students to disciplinary similarities and differences in the perspectives, theories, concepts, assumptions, and methods used by sociologists (who focus on what happens between individuals) and psychologists (who focus on what happens within). The authors vary from year to year but include Malcolm Gladwell, Michelle Alexander, Nate Silver, and Nicholas Christakis.

We begin by reviewing the legal foundations of immigrant labor, including the current immigration enforcement regime, and the role of legal status in labor standards enforcement protections.  We examine how organized labor has evolved with regards to immigrant workers, shifting from supporting employer sanctions in 1986, to repudiating them as a tool for employer control in 2001.  We then evaluate the role that immigrant workers have played in the revitalization of the labor movement, and the challenges that remain for unions.  Beyond unions, we examine the emergence of new forms of worker representation, including the varying types of worker centers.  We focus on the proliferation of day labor centers, and more recently, non-union efforts to organize workers in the restaurant industry.  We even consider the role of undocumented workers in the public sector, made possible through the increased use of subcontracting. We look at how public entities have turned to worker organizations to help hold employers accountable, and how workers have turned to local governments to strengthen worker protections (such as higher minimum wages and strengthened penalties for wage theft), as well as how states have become new targets for policy change  (such as recent victories for domestic workers).  We also discuss binational efforts to advance immigrant worker rights.  We end by considering prospects for federal immigration reform, and the implications these proposals may have for immigrant worker rights.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":362999,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"3071","titleShort":"Governing Economic Development","titleLong":"Governing Economic Development: The U.S. Experience","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16332,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ra40","firstName":"Ronald","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Applegate"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Surveys the history of U.S. Economic development from the perspective of the governance structures created to organize and control economic activity, emphasizing the changing regulatory roles of public and private institutions.

The intent is to provide seniors with an opportunity to summon, integrate, and apply insights that they have acquired over the course of their undergraduate education, and give prospective graduate students the opportunity to lead discussions in a large introductory lecture course, \"Six Pretty Good Books\" (HD/ILRLR/COMM/SOC 2580). Each seminar member is part of a two or three-person team that leads the discussion together, under the supervision of a graduate teaching assistant. Seminar meetings are devoted to building lesson plans for leading an effective discussion of each of the six books.

Given the emphasis on skill building, the course will make extensive use of mediation simulations alongside classroom lectures and discussions.  "}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Mediating Organizational Conflicts"}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"3035","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Topics change depending on semester and instructor.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":363001,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"6082","titleShort":"CB Negotiations Simulation","titleLong":"CB Negotiations Simulation","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16383,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"10:00PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"hsk11","firstName":"Henry","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Kramer"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Students prepare for and participate in a simulated negotiation between a hypothetical corporation and a hypothetical union in a typical big company within a midsize single site bargaining unit context. Students are assigned, usually in line with preferences, to a management or union bargaining team. The course stresses the negotiation process over settlement or substantive outcomes. Negotiation problems are as real life as possible, constrained by student time needs and with attention given to dynamic legal,political, economic, and communications concerns as well as power, information, and time factors. Participants plan for negotiations, reach agreements in principle, negotiate language, and bargain over wages, pensions, health care, and noneconomic items in the context of a company and union with an established contract, policies, and culture. This is a small, hands-on, interactive, program with active participation essential.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Attendance at first class is vital; no student accepted if not enrolled before second class.
