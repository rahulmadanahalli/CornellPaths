This course evaluates claims about the strengths and limitations of the contemporary American jury. We will examine the image of the jury in popular culture, then explore the work of lawyers, legal scholars, psychologists, and other social scientists who have studied the jury in depth. Questions we'll address during the course include: Do juries represent all segments of their communities? Can lawyers stack a jury in their favor? Are jurors influenced by the \"CSI effect?\" What should judges do about googling and tweeting jurors? How do jurors use trial evidence and legal rules to decide on verdicts, damage awards, or decisions to sentence a defendant to death? By the course's end, students should be able to reach their own informed judgment about this perennially controversial institution.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: undergraduates only.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":351446,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"5001","titleShort":"Civil Procedure","titleLong":"Civil Procedure","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17827,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"03:25PM","startDt":"08/27/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"kmc12","firstName":"Kevin","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Clermont"}],"pattern":"TWR","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 184","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH184","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/27/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"002","classNbr":17828,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:10PM","startDt":"08/27/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"bjh12","firstName":"Barbara","middleName":"Jean","lastName":"Holden-Smith"}],"pattern":"TWR","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall G90","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTHG90","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/27/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"An introduction to civil litigation, from commencement of an action through disposition on appeal, studied in the context of the federal procedural system.

presentations. Assignments are usually set in the context of a simulated law office (or judge's chambers). In the fall semester, students write predictive memoranda that point out the strengths and weaknesses of their client's case. To prepare the memoranda, students may need to determine the facts of the case by conducting interviews or depositions. Acting as junior attorneys, students will also make an oral presentation to a supervising attorney. The spring semester focuses on persuasive advocacy. Students prepare a memorandum, motion, or brief for submission to a court and, later, orally argue for their positions in a simulated court session. Throughout the year, students also learn the fundamentals of legal research. Instruction occurs not only in full-class sessions but also in individual conferences. Students receive extensive feedback on each major assignment.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.

These concerns arise sharply in the context of the inclusion of social and economic rights in a constitution that is to be interpreted and enforced by the courts. Is the enforcement of these rights by courts undemocratic? Does the inclusion of these rights in a constitution force courts to violate the principle of the separation of powers because in the course of adjudicating on these rights courts are invariably required to make decisions that have implications for the allocation of resources and the formulation of policy? Do courts have the institutional competence to make decisions that are polycentric in nature? To lay foundation for exploring these concerns, the seminar will consider (a) the foundation of social and economic rights; (b) the emergence of the international regime on social and economic rights; and (c) various methods use in national legal systems to protect social and economic rights. The debate on the role of the judiciary in the enforcement of social and economic rights will be explored in the light of judicial experiences in countries such as India, South Africa, United States and Northern Ireland.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Limited enrollment.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":366067,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7440","titleShort":"Law and Social Change","titleLong":"Law and Social Change: Comparative Law in Africa","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18070,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"08/27/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"cgb28","firstName":"Cynthia","middleName":"G.","lastName":"Bowman"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mbn5","firstName":"Muna","middleName":"B.","lastName":"Ndulo"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall G81","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTHG81","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/27/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":null,"catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":364077,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7572","titleShort":"Litigation Drafting","titleLong":"Litigation Drafting","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18071,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"08/27/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lgf28","firstName":"Lara","middleName":"G.","lastName":"Freed"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 182","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH182","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/27/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course focuses on drafting documents typically encountered during the pretrial phase of civil litigation.

The legal issues both within the military and surrounding our military actions have risen to the forefront throughout the course of these conflicts. This seminar will explore those issues, taking a historical perspective on the evolution of the law as it intersects with the military while primarily focusing on the legal issues facing our country today. Topics will include a discussion of the military court-martial system as compared to the Article III civilian federal court system and the use of courts-martial to try non-military contractors employed in war environments. We will also examine the use of targeted killings and the detention of individuals in combat, including scrutiny of the developing case law regarding habeas rights for individuals the military has detained and the use of military commissions. This course is designed to elicit discussion from both a policy and legal perspective on these current issues while helping to broaden the students' understanding of how law impacts our military forces and how our military can be used to spread the Rule of Law. The course content will touch upon issues raised in criminal law, international law, national security law and the law of armed conflict. Students will be graded on two papers and their participation in classroom discussion.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the writing requirement.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":362855,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7631","titleShort":"Pretrial Pract., Lit.

In addition to the domestic labor law inquiries, interested students may have the opportunity to address international labor law topics as well. The international labor law work typically occurs in Latin America. During the semester, there will likely be two guest speakers and two panel discussions on timely labor law topics, which students will be required to attend, along with weekly meetings to discuss case preparation and advancement.

The primary research vehicle is an operational website, RegRoom.org, which features live public commenting moderated by Clinic students.

Through a critical seminar and practical case and project work, students will examine and engage in local, global, and transnational efforts to combat gender violence and discrimination. Students will develop skills such as interviewing, fact-finding, project and case management, international and comparative legal research, legal drafting, and oral advocacy by working on projects and cases for human rights organizations, judges, intergovernmental human rights experts or bodies, and individuals. The course will give students hands-on experience in diverse methods of human rights advocacy, including fact-finding and reporting, legal assistance and counseling, domestic and international litigation, and human rights education. Project work focuses on issues related to gender justice such as: domestic violence; so-called \"honor\" crimes, gender violence in schools, prisons or other institutional settings; gender and HIV/AIDS; sexual offenses in armed conflict; child marriage; violations of women's property and inheritance rights; and trafficking in persons. Students will also have the opportunity to examine critically the ethical, political, cultural, and other challenges that affect the promotion of global gender justice. Some projects may involve optional domestic or international travel, and some projects may address gender justice issues within the United States. Students who wish to apply to the clinic should pre-register and also submit a resume, transcript, and statement of interest to Prof. Brundige (eb456@cornell.edu) by the end of the pre-registration period.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Limited enrollment.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":366875,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7915","titleShort":"Adv.

presentations. Assignments are usually set in the context of a simulated law office (or judge's chambers). In the fall semester, students write predictive memoranda that point out the strengths and weaknesses of their client's case. To prepare the memoranda, students may need to determine the facts of the case by conducting interviews or depositions. Acting as junior attorneys, students will also make an oral presentation to a supervising attorney. The spring semester focuses on persuasive advocacy. Students prepare a memorandum, motion, or brief for submission to a court and, later, orally argue for their positions in a simulated court session. Throughout the year, students also learn the fundamentals of legal research. Instruction occurs not only in full-class sessions but also in individual conferences. Students receive extensive feedback on each major assignment.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.

The course will consider the adequacy of this legal system in addressing regional and global needs to achieve sustainability. Critical aspects of sustainability include: climate change, increasing frequency and magnitude of disasters including droughts and floods, marine resources, energy, biodiversity, genetic resources and associated intellectual property issues, and trade and economic development. These crosscutting challenges must balance conflicting goals of economic development and environmental sustainability.

We will, for example, read classics of the law and literature movement by James Boyd White and Robert Cover, then inquire as to how recent work-such as the essays in Victoria Kahn and Lorna Hutson's collection Rhetoric and Law in Early Modern Europe-might differ in approach. The rest of the course will be organized around a series of speakers, some drawn from Cornell and some from other universities. The students will convene for a half hour at the beginning of the session, which will then be opened to a larger community, including faculty members, for the talk itself.\nStudents will be required to write six three- to five-page papers responding to the speakers' pre-circulated talks; these will be due in advance of the class session and shown to those lecturing in order to prompt and enhance discussion.

A central theme will be the question whether and to what degree welfare, well-being, and wealth for that matter can be understood apart from and even as determinative of normative propriety (\"rightness\" and \"wrongness\"), or whether instead these concepts presuppose a prior conception of normative propriety. Many legal and economic theorists seem to assume the former, but this assumption can -- and in this course will -- be examined critically.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the writing requirement.","catalogPermission":"Limited enrollment.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":367095,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7672","titleShort":"Race and the Criminal Justice","titleLong":"Race and the Criminal Justice System","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17749,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"01/20/2015","endDt":"04/24/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"jm347","firstName":"Joseph","middleName":"","lastName":"Margulies"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 389","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH389","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/20/2015","endDt":"04/24/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar will try to answer one of the most sensitive questions facing Americans today: Why are African Americans grossly over-represented in the American criminal justice system? Some answer this question with a simple accusation that the system is racist in design and implementation, and point to familiar statistics to buttress their claim. African Americans are eight times more likely to be incarcerated than whites. As of 2004, over 12% of African American men between the ages of 25 and 29 were in custody. For under-educated young black men, the incarceration rates are simply astounding: in 2000, nearly one in five African-American men under 41 who had not attended college were in prison or jail. Yet these statistics, as dispiriting as they are, must open the debate, not end it. While no one credibly doubts the persistence of racially biased decision-making throughout the criminal justice system, careful empirical research strongly suggests that overt discrimination plays a relatively modest role in producing the current state of play. The explanations for the disparities that haunt the criminal justice system are nuanced and complex, and therefore deserving of careful study. Absorbing lessons from a wide variety of disciplines, including history, sociology, political science, economics, and law, this seminar will try to shed light on this vexing American problem. Attendance, preparation, and participation are mandatory. Because the literature on this topic is voluminous, the readings for each class will range across a wide field. I expect the time commitment to be substantial. Still, there are no special course requirements. Grades will be based on class participation (15%) and a research paper (85%) due at the end of term. As part of the course, I will try to arrange a tour of a Maximum Security Prison, the timing of which will be determined once registration is complete and we have a roster of students. To accommodate the visit, the reading schedule may be adjusted as needed.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Limited enrollment.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":367096,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7675","titleShort":"Issues in Financial Regulation","titleLong":"Issues in Financial Regulation","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17764,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"01/20/2015","endDt":"04/24/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sto24","firstName":"Saule","middleName":"T","lastName":"Omarova"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 276","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH276","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/20/2015","endDt":"04/24/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar will seek to introduce students to a broad range of legal and regulatory issues that arise in connection with, and as a result of, financial innovation and increasing globalization of financial markets and institutions.

Earlier that fall, the SS commandants, officers and guards who had been arrested by the British upon the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, had been tried before a British military tribunal. These were the first of numerous trials of Nazi war criminals and related criminal and civil proceedings arising out of the Holocaust. This seminar will examine legal and ethical issues raised in these and other trials of Nazi war criminals and individuals accused of collaborating with the Nazis in perpetrating crimes against humanity, including the 1947 \"Justice Trial\" of Nazi judges and senior officials of the Third Reich Ministry of Justice, the Eichmann Trial in Jerusalem and the 1963-64 Tel Aviv trial of Hersz Barenblat, the head of the Jewish police in the ghetto of Bedzin, Poland.

Use of Web 2.0 technologies and social networking tools to elicit public comment in rulemaking and other policymaking is especially emphasized. However, several significant legal, communications, and technological challenges exist. The e-Government Clinic, which grows out of the research of CeRI (the Cornell e-Rulemaking Initiative), engages students in theoretical development and practical application of principals of public law, deliberative democracy, conflict resolution, and collaborative decision-making in the contexts of Web-enabled rulemaking, regulatory review, and strategic planning. The primary research vehicle is an operational website, RegRoom.org, which features live public commenting moderated by Clinic students.

Examples of individual litigation cases are: representing a lesbian woman seeking asylum from Jamaica based on her sexual orientation and assisting a transgender woman in a men's prison challenging the conditions of her confinement. Students will handle all stages of any legal proceedings in immigration court, state court, or other forums. Examples of advocacy projects include presenting a community education workshop in how LGBT seniors can protect their legal rights and writing a report on access to domestic violence shelters for LGBT domestic violence victims. The seminar portion is a practice-oriented examination of advocacy on behalf of LGBT people and of social justice lawyering generally.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"Attendance is mandatory at the first class.

presentations. Assignments are usually set in the context of a simulated law office (or judge's chambers). In the fall semester, students write predictive memoranda that point out the strengths and weaknesses of their client's case. To prepare the memoranda, students may need to determine the facts of the case by conducting interviews or depositions. Acting as junior attorneys, students will also make an oral presentation to a supervising attorney. The spring semester focuses on persuasive advocacy. Students prepare a memorandum, motion, or brief for submission to a court and, later, orally argue for their positions in a simulated court session. Throughout the year, students also learn the fundamentals of legal research. Instruction occurs not only in full-class sessions but also in individual conferences. Students receive extensive feedback on each major assignment.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring (yearlong).","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":350053,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"5090","titleShort":"Advanced Financial Stat Analy","titleLong":"Advanced Financial Statement Analysis","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18171,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:55AM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"10/12/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":8,"netid":"kjm267","firstName":"Kenneth","middleName":"Joe","lastName":"Merkley"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B10","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB10","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"10/12/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Graded(GRI)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5090","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"10/12/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"002","classNbr":18172,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"10/12/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":8,"netid":"kjm267","firstName":"Kenneth","middleName":"Joe","lastName":"Merkley"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"10/12/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Graded(GRI)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5090","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"10/12/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"003","classNbr":18173,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"10/12/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":8,"netid":"kjm267","firstName":"Kenneth","middleName":"Joe","lastName":"Merkley"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"10/12/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Graded(GRI)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5090","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"10/12/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"}],"description":"This course builds on the material of NBA 5060Â and focuses on more advanced financial statement topics and specialized industries.

This introductory course will expose students to several facets of a deposition: preparing for deposition, asking questions at a deposition, defending the witness at a deposition, using documents at a deposition, and reviewing the transcript of a deposition. Students can expect to take and defend mock depositions and to observe and critique their fellow students' deposition skills.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"Students who have already taken Pretrial Discovery: Depositions (two-credit class) or Deposition Skills (one-credit class) may not enroll in this class.","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the skills requirement.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":364069,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6570","titleShort":"Introduction to Chinese Law","titleLong":"Introduction to Chinese Law","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18668,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:10PM","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"xy64","firstName":"Xingzhong","middleName":"","lastName":"Yu"}],"pattern":"MRF","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall (Hughes) 146","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH146","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course is designed to provide students with an introduction to the nature and function of law in China.

Students will participate in a semester-long colloquium and conference series on law and culture in East Asia in which Cornell faculty and guest speakers from around the world will present new research on current legal issues in the region.

These concerns arise sharply in the context of the inclusion of social and economic rights in a constitution that is to be interpreted and enforced by the courts. Is the enforcement of these rights by courts undemocratic? Does the inclusion of these rights in a constitution force courts to violate the principle of the separation of powers because in the course of adjudicating on these rights courts are invariably required to make decisions that have implications for the allocation of resources and the formulation of policy? Do courts have the institutional competence to make decisions that are polycentric in nature? To lay foundation for exploring these concerns, the seminar will consider (a) the foundation of social and economic rights; (b) the emergence of the international regime on social and economic rights; and (c) various methods use in national legal systems to protect social and economic rights. The debate on the role of the judiciary in the enforcement of social and economic rights will be explored in the light of judicial experiences in countries such as India, South Africa, United States and Northern Ireland.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Limited enrollment.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":366034,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7394","titleShort":"Labor Migration & Trafficking","titleLong":"Labor Migration and Trafficking","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18711,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"06:05PM","timeEnd":"07:55PM","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ct343","firstName":"Chantal","middleName":"","lastName":"Thomas"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 277","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH277","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"A new, rapidly evolving body of international and domestic law focuses on human trafficking and human smuggling.

The seminar will include an introduction to multiple African legal systems, as well as African customary law, constitutional law, labor law, property law and family law. The seminar will examine the current law in the context of changes that have taken place in African society from colonization through the present day. Students will read cases and statutes from multiple African countries. Students will be encouraged to choose an area of law to conduct a comparative analysis in the required final paper. The seminar creates opportunities for multicultural experiences through immersion in South Africa's society and culture during a three-week winter trip to Johannesburg, South Africa, where students will receive instruction at the University of Johannesburg. (Travel assistance will be available based on demonstrated need. Please contact, Program Manager, IAD at 190 Uris Hall for more information.) The main objective of this aspect of the program is to enhance and reinforce academic learning by providing students the opportunity to actively engage with individuals and organizations directly involved in the administration of law in Africa in a variety of concentrations. The seminar will examine problems of law and how they have been addressed in Africa with particular attention to the interaction of the common law, African customary law, and other imported systems of law. Legal interaction between Africa and Europe, which began before colonial rule, intensified during the colonial period and has continued after independence. During the Colonial period, the Common Law and Civil law were imported into Africa and operated alongside customary law. The result is that pluralism of law is a common feature of legal systems in nearly all African states. The conflicts between the imported laws and customary law have generated considerable interest in reform and the integration of laws in various African countries as well as creating an opportunity to look to other legal system for alternative approaches.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367660,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7460","titleShort":"Lawyers in the Movies","titleLong":"Lawyers in the Movies","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18749,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ggm42","firstName":"Greg","middleName":"","lastName":"Murphy"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 387","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH387","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar will examine the influence film has had on how lawyers perceive themselves, and how society perceives lawyers, the legal profession, and the ethical standards of the legal profession.Â  We will study relevant scholarly material.Â  We will critique depictions of lawyers in films, lawyering, and the ethics of the profession as portrayed in film and television programs.Â  We will also spend time discussing trial techniques to be learned from the depictions of lawyers in movies.Â  This seminar will require each student to write independently a paper of at least 30 pages.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Rcommended prerequisite: previous completion of a basic trial advocacy course.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367659,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7597","titleShort":"Neoliberal Jurisprudence","titleLong":"Neoliberal Jurisprudence","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18748,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"wlb75","firstName":"Wendy","middleName":"Lynn","lastName":"Brown"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall G81","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTHG81","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"In this seminar, we will read selected cases, theory and analyses to study the precise mechanics involved and issues at stake in extending human rights to for-profit businesses and corporations.

Our discussions will range across discrimination on grounds of sex, race, religion, sexuality, political viewpoint, and many other grounds. Examples will be taken from US constitutional law and from federal legislation, but also from the law of other jurisdictions. The seminar is about theoretical puzzles that cross the boundaries between different places and times and contexts, rather than about policy design or advocacy. Our puzzles will include: What exactly is wrong with discrimination, when it is wrong? Does the wrongness depend on the consequences? What makes a certain ground of discrimination an improper ground? Is it wrong to discriminate on such grounds in friendships, romantic relationships, etc. as well as in employment, schooling, etc.? Is indirect discrimination ('disparate impact') really a kind of discrimination? Is there any essential connection between discrimination and equality? Why is discrimination a suitable matter for legal regulation, rather than something to be left to private ethics or the market? As these sample questions suggest, we will not shy away from testing our most basic and cherished assumptions. Although there are no prerequisites, some knowledge of the Civil Rights Act 1964 (or similar legislation) would be an advantage. The seminar attracts 2 credits and meets the writing requirement.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":351869,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7781","titleShort":"Theories of Property","titleLong":"Theories of Property","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18717,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"gsa9","firstName":"Greg","middleName":"","lastName":"Alexander"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall G81","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTHG81","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar will provide an introduction to the most influential contemporary theories of property, as well as an opportunity to discuss how those theories might approach several important questions within property law.

Earlier that fall, the SS commandants, officers and guards who had been arrested by the British upon the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, had been tried before a British military tribunal. These were the first of numerous trials of Nazi war criminals and related criminal and civil proceedings arising out of the Holocaust. This seminar will examine legal and ethical issues raised in these and other trials of Nazi war criminals and individuals accused of collaborating with the Nazis in perpetrating crimes against humanity, including the 1947 \"Justice Trial\" of Nazi judges and senior officials of the Third Reich Ministry of Justice, the Eichmann Trial in Jerusalem and the 1963-64 Tel Aviv trial of Hersz Barenblat, the head of the Jewish police in the ghetto of Bedzin, Poland. The course will also examine the history of the Genocide Convention, and the developing law of genocide and crimes against humanity with respect to atrocities in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Darfur, including the evolving law on rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the professional responsibility writing requirement and the writing requirement.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":364872,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7805","titleShort":"Advanced Labor Law Clinic","titleLong":"Advanced Labor Law Clinic","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"CLN","ssrComponentLong":"Clinical","section":"301","classNbr":18719,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"abc49","firstName":"Angela","middleName":"B.","lastName":"Cornell"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["CLN"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The Advanced Labor Law Clinic provides students another opportunity to deepen their understanding of traditional labor and employment law by representing the interests of workers with typical workplace issues.

Use of Web 2.0 technologies and social networking tools to elicit public comment in rulemaking and other policymaking is especially emphasized. However, several significant legal, communications, and technological challenges exist. The e-Government Clinic, which grows out of the research of CeRI (the Cornell e-Rulemaking Initiative), engages students in theoretical development and practical application of principals of public law, deliberative democracy, conflict resolution, and collaborative decision-making in the contexts of Web-enabled rulemaking, regulatory review, and strategic planning. The primary research vehicle is an operational website, RegRoom.org, which features live public commenting moderated by Clinic students.

The course will give students hands-on experience in diverse methods of human rights advocacy, including fact-finding and reporting, legal assistance and counseling, domestic and international litigation, and human rights education. Project work focuses on issues related to gender justice such as: domestic violence; so-called \"honor\" crimes, gender violence in schools, prisons or other institutional settings; gender and HIV/AIDS; sexual offenses in armed conflict; child marriage; violations of women's property and inheritance rights; and trafficking in persons.

course designed to introduce first-year students to lawyering skills, with primary emphasis on legal writing, analysis, research, and oral presentations. Assignments are usually set in the context of a simulated law office (or judge's chambers). In the fall semester, students write predictive memoranda that point out the strengths and weaknesses of their client's case. To prepare the memoranda, students may need to determine the facts of the case by conducting interviews or depositions. Acting as junior attorneys, students will also make an oral presentation to a supervising attorney. The spring semester focuses on persuasive advocacy. Students prepare a memorandum, motion, or brief for submission to a court and, later, orally argue for their positions in a simulated court session.

This introductory course will expose students to several facets of a deposition: preparing for deposition, asking questions at a deposition, defending the witness at a deposition, using documents at a deposition, and reviewing the transcript of a deposition.

We begin by examining the foundational question of what justifies criminal punishment and what limits there might be on its imposition. In addition to examining how consequentialist considerations might impact the criminal law, we will distinguish penal dessert from other forms of moral blameworthiness, and examine how punishment as a response to wrongdoing differs from other non-penal responses to wrongs. With this background, we proceed to investigate the theoretical foundations of particular doctrines in the criminal law. These include i) the requirement of concurrence between actus reus and mens rea, ii) the requirement of a voluntary act, iii) the insanity defense, iv) questions about what kind of mens rea and causation are required for accomplice liability, and v) the age-old question of why we punish attempts less harshly than completed crimes. Students will submit three short reaction papers in response to the weekly readings, and one of these will be turned into a final research paper in consultation with the instructor.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: first-year criminal law course.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":367923,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7055","titleShort":"Adv.

Particular attention will be paid to the question of jurisdiction over international crimes. It will consider international crimes such as aggression; war crimes, crimes against humanity, terrorism, and torture. It will also consider the treatment of past human rights violations in post conflict situations. It will further consider procedural aspects of international criminal law and the forums that deal with international crimes. In that context, it will look at the structure, jurisdiction and jurisprudence of Truth Commissions; the International Criminal Court (The Rome Statute); the former Yugoslavia Tribunal; Rwanda Tribunal and extradition and mutual legal assistance. The format will be class discussions of assigned readings. Final assessment in the course will be based on participation in class discussions and a written paper on a subject falling within the themes of the seminar. Paper topics must be submitted to the instructor for review not later than the third week of class.

This year, the colloquium will focus on the topic of \"law and justice.\" The course will begin with three weeks of seminar designed to apprise students of existing work in law and the humanities and to situate current developments within this broader frame, concentrating on the often complicated relationship between law and justice. We will examine, for example, debates about voting, trial procedure, the prison system, citizenship, and other aspects of democratic process.

These clients will typically have represented themselves pro se in Immigration Court. During the first part of the semester students will learn substantive and procedural asylum and Convention Against Torture (CAT) law, such as the nature of persecution, grounds for asylum and CAT claims, and the practical and social effects that these laws have on new immigrants who seek asylum or CAT relief. Classes may also cover practical knowledge needed for effective representation, such as advanced research and writing skills. During the second part of the semester, students will work in teams of two on appellate briefs. These briefs will not only entail serious legal analysis, but may also require sociocultural and political research, so that the students can effectively write about the conditions of the client's home country. Students will interview clients over the phone during this time, with the possibility of face-to-face interviews. Some clients may be incarcerated, and many will be out-of-state.

The students' cases will provide a basis for more in-depth substantive learning, as well as practical skills and attorney-client issues.

In addition to the domestic labor law inquiries, interested students may have the opportunity to address international labor law topics as well. The international labor law work typically occurs in Latin America. During the semester, there will likely be two guest speakers and two panel discussions on timely labor law topics, which students will be required to attend, along with weekly meetings to discuss case preparation and advancement.

The students' best skills will be put to practice while they work towards creating an atmosphere of trust and comfort for their clients and learning the essentials of establishing solid attorney-client relationships. Specifically, students will be working in pairs under supervision of faculty to prepare an actual estate plan for the client which includes a last will and testament, a living will, a health care proxy and a power of attorney along with the statutory major gifts rider (if applicable). Students will take part in the entire estate planning process from the initial informational intake meeting, to the preparation of the client's estate planning documents, to discussing the drafts with the clients along with addressing their comments and changes and to preparing and assisting with the execution of the client's estate planning documents.

Through a critical seminar and practical case and project work, students will examine and engage in local, global, and transnational efforts to combat gender violence and discrimination. Students will develop skills such as interviewing, fact-finding, project and case management, international and comparative legal research, legal drafting, and oral advocacy by working on projects and cases for human rights organizations, judges, intergovernmental human rights experts or bodies, and individuals. The course will give students hands-on experience in diverse methods of human rights advocacy, including fact-finding and reporting, legal assistance and counseling, domestic and international litigation, and human rights education. Project work focuses on issues related to gender justice such as: domestic violence; so-called \"honor\" crimes, gender violence in schools, prisons or other institutional settings; gender and HIV/AIDS; sexual offenses in armed conflict; child marriage; violations of women's property and inheritance rights; and trafficking in persons. Students will also have the opportunity to examine critically the ethical, political, cultural, and other challenges that affect the promotion of global gender justice. Some projects may involve optional domestic or international travel, and some projects may address gender justice issues within the United States. Students who wish to apply to the clinic should pre-register and also submit a resume, transcript, and statement of interest to Prof. Brundige (eb456@cornell.edu) by the end of the pre-registration period.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-CEL, CU-ITL)","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Limited enrollment.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":366875,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7915","titleShort":"Adv.

The course is offered on an accelerated basis. The course introduces students to basic business concepts that are fundamental to business practice and to upper-level business courses, but that many students are unlikely to be familiar with if they did not major in business at the undergraduate level. In particular, the course will provide a basic introduction to the following concepts: Debt, Interest, and Present Value; Basic Business Forms (proprietorship, partnership, corporation, LLC); Capital Structure (equity, debt, and variations on the same like preferred and ABS); Basic Accounting (balance sheets, earnings statements, statements of cash flow); Basic Valuation (book value, discounted cash flow, etc.); Securities Markets (a short introduction to the offering process and to the secondary markets for stocks, bonds, asset-back securities and

course designed to introduce first-year students to lawyering skills, with primary emphasis on legal writing, analysis, research, and oral presentations. Assignments are usually set in the context of a simulated law office (or judge's chambers). In the fall semester, students write predictive memoranda that point out the strengths and weaknesses of their client's case. To prepare the memoranda, students may need to determine the facts of the case by conducting interviews or depositions. Acting as junior attorneys, students will also make an oral presentation to a supervising attorney. The spring semester focuses on persuasive advocacy. Students prepare a memorandum, motion, or brief for submission to a court and, later, orally argue for their positions in a simulated court session. Throughout the year, students also learn the fundamentals of legal research. Instruction occurs not only in full-class sessions but also in individual conferences. Students receive extensive feedback on each major assignment.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring (yearlong).","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":350053,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"5090","titleShort":"Advanced Financial Stat Analy","titleLong":"Advanced Financial Statement Analysis","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15629,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":8,"netid":"kjm267","firstName":"Kenneth","middleName":"Joe","lastName":"Merkley"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B10","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB10","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5090","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"10/10/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"002","classNbr":15630,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":8,"netid":"kjm267","firstName":"Kenneth","middleName":"Joe","lastName":"Merkley"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5090","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"10/10/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"003","classNbr":15631,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":8,"netid":"kjm267","firstName":"Kenneth","middleName":"Joe","lastName":"Merkley"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5090","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"10/10/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"}],"description":"This course builds on the material of NBA 5060Â and focuses on more advanced financial statement topics and specialized industries.

Indeed, many cases are lost, won, or settled because of information gleaned at a deposition. Attorneys also often modify trial strategies because of a witness's performance at a deposition. Because depositions play such an important role in litigation, the majority of junior litigation attorneys can expect to deal with depositions in some manner from the very start of their careers. This introductory course will expose students to several facets of a deposition: preparing for deposition, asking questions at a deposition, defending the witness at a deposition, using documents at a deposition, and reviewing the transcript of a deposition. Students can expect to take and defend mock depositions and to observe and critique their fellow students' deposition skills.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"Forbidden Overlap: students who have already taken Pretrial Discovery: Depositions (two-credit class) or Deposition Skills (one-credit class) may not enroll in this class.","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the skills requirement.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":364111,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6572","titleShort":"Intro Transactional Lawyering","titleLong":"Introduction to Transactional Lawyering","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18042,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:05AM","startDt":"08/24/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"cwb94","firstName":"Celia","middleName":"","lastName":"Bigoness"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 290","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH290","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/24/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The conventional law school curriculum implicitly emphasizes appellate litigation, teaching students to read, argue and distinguish cases, and to predict what a judge will do.

This course, co-taught by a financially trained and experienced lawyer and a legally trained and experienced financier, both with backgrounds in macroeconomics, critically examines the linkages among law, money, and financial macrodynamics, as well as the thought of some leading thinkers and policymakers in these fields over the past century or so.

The seminar will include an introduction to multiple African legal systems, as well as African customary law, constitutional law, labor law, property law and family law. The seminar will examine the current law in the context of changes that have taken place in African society from colonization through the present day. Students will read cases and statutes from multiple African countries. Students will be encouraged to choose an area of law to conduct a comparative analysis in the required final paper. The seminar creates opportunities for multicultural experiences through immersion in South Africa's society and culture during a three-week winter trip to Johannesburg, South Africa, where students will receive instruction at the University of Johannesburg. (Travel assistance will be available based on demonstrated need. Please contact, Program Manager, IAD at 190 Uris Hall for more information.) The main objective of this aspect of the program is to enhance and reinforce academic learning by providing students the opportunity to actively engage with individuals and organizations directly involved in the administration of law in Africa in a variety of concentrations. The seminar will examine problems of law and how they have been addressed in Africa with particular attention to the interaction of the common law, African customary law, and other imported systems of law. Legal interaction between Africa and Europe, which began before colonial rule, intensified during the colonial period and has continued after independence. During the Colonial period, the Common Law and Civil law were imported into Africa and operated alongside customary law. The result is that pluralism of law is a common feature of legal systems in nearly all African states. The conflicts between the imported laws and customary law have generated considerable interest in reform and the integration of laws in various African countries as well as creating an opportunity to look to other legal system for alternative approaches.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":364077,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7572","titleShort":"Litigation Drafting","titleLong":"Litigation Drafting","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18156,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"08/24/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lgf28","firstName":"Lara","middleName":"G.","lastName":"Freed"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 276","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH276","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/24/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course focuses on drafting documents typically encountered during the pretrial phase of civil litigation.

In the context of Constitutional interpretation we will pay close attention to the rationale of constitutionalism, how it bears on constitutional interpretation, and how it explains the various ideological disputes between justices of the supreme court about the grounds and the legitimacy of their constitutional decisions.Â ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":362299,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7785","titleShort":"War Crimes Trials and the Law","titleLong":"War Crimes Trials and the Law of Genocide","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18172,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/24/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mzr3","firstName":"Menachem","middleName":"Z.","lastName":"Rosensaft"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 277","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH277","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/24/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Beginning in November 1945, in an unprecedented attempt to bring war criminals to justice, more than 20 senior government officials and military leaders of HitlerÊ¼s Third Reich were indicted and tried, in what has become known as the Nuremberg Trial, for crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Earlier that fall, the SS commandants, officers and guards who had been arrested by the British upon the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, had been tried before a British military tribunal. These were the first of numerous trials of Nazi war criminals and related criminal and civil proceedings arising out of the Holocaust. This seminar will examine legal and ethical issues raised in these and other trials of Nazi war criminals and individuals accused of collaborating with the Nazis in perpetrating crimes against humanity, including the 1947 \"Justice Trial\" of Nazi judges and senior officials of the Third Reich Ministry of Justice, the Eichmann Trial in Jerusalem and the 1963-64 Tel Aviv trial of Hersz Barenblat, the head of the Jewish police in the ghetto of Bedzin, Poland. The course will also examine the history of the Genocide Convention, and the developing law of genocide and crimes against humanity with respect to atrocities in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Darfur, including the evolving law on rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the professional responsibility writing requirement and the writing requirement.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":362859,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7832","titleShort":"Externship - Full Time","titleLong":"Externship - Full Time","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"CLN","ssrComponentLong":"Clinical","section":"301","classNbr":18237,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"08/24/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"chf54","firstName":"Catherine","middleName":"H","lastName":"Finn"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/24/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":12,"unitsMaximum":12,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["CLN"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The Externship - Full Time course allows students (24 in fall, 16 in spring) to earn 12 credit hours as externs working full time at approved placement sites at virtually any location (most sites are non-profit organizations or governmental agencies) during the fall or spring semester of their third year or the spring semester of their second year.

For more information about the clinic, email Prof. Lyon (beth.lyon@cornell.edu) and schedule a meeting. This course requires off premises travel to meet with clients and participate in hearings. Employment on a farm is one of the worlds' most difficult and dangerous occupations. Farmworkers experience geographic, linguistic, and cultural isolation, separation from family, immigration insecurity reinforced by policing practices, workplace sexual violence, and exclusion from protective employment laws. Working with the new clinic's community partners, Farmworker Legal Assistance Clinic I student attorneys will handle immigration and employment matters on behalf of farmworkers in the region, work that will typically involve negotiation and often require litigation. Students will also work in brief advice and referral outreach sessions in farmworker communities. Clinic participants may also have the opportunity to work on research and writing projects with civil rights, environmental protection, and farmworker rights organizations. Farmworker Clinic students will participate in a lawyering seminar and work with a clinic partner on their assigned cases. The lawyering seminar will focus on skills students need for effective client representation.

Students develop skills such as interviewing, client counseling, fact-finding, legal research, brief-writing, negotiating on behalf of clients, and conducting hearings. Examples of individual litigation cases are: representing a lesbian woman seeking asylum from Jamaica based on her sexual orientation and assisting a transgender woman in a men's prison challenging the conditions of her confinement. Students will handle all stages of any legal proceedings in immigration court, state court, or other forums. Examples of advocacy projects include presenting a community education workshop in how LGBT seniors can protect their legal rights and writing a report on access to domestic violence shelters for LGBT domestic violence victims.

course designed to introduce first-year students to lawyering skills, with primary emphasis on legal writing, analysis, research, and oral presentations. Assignments are usually set in the context of a simulated law office (or judge's chambers). In the fall semester, students write predictive memoranda that point out the strengths and weaknesses of their client's case. To prepare the memoranda, students may need to determine the facts of the case by conducting interviews or depositions. Acting as junior attorneys, students will also make an oral presentation to a supervising attorney. The spring semester focuses on persuasive advocacy. Students prepare a memorandum, motion, or brief for submission to a court and, later, orally argue for their positions in a simulated court session. Throughout the year, students also learn the fundamentals of legal research. Instruction occurs not only in full-class sessions but also in individual conferences. Students receive extensive feedback on each major assignment.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring (yearlong).","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":351487,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"5121","titleShort":"Property","titleLong":"Property","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15978,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:05AM","timeEnd":"10:00AM","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"gt276","firstName":"Gerald","middleName":"","lastName":"Torres"}],"pattern":"MTWR","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall G85","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTHG85","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"002","classNbr":15979,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lu27","firstName":"Laura","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Underkuffler"}],"pattern":"WR","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 182","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH182","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:30PM","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 182","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH182","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This is a course in basic property law.

Although topics may be modified over each semester, a wide range of topics is expected to be covered, including: Choice of Entity; Founders' Agreement(s); Terms of Preferred Stock, including Liquidation Preferences and Conversion Mechanics; Basic Deal Structuring; Tax Issues/Benefits for Entrepreneurs/Startups; Employment and Incentive Considerations; Basic Securities Regulation; Convertible Notes and SAFEs; Series A Financing; Special Considerations with High Valuations and Unicorns; Distressed Situations and Down Rounds; Operational Agreements; Indebtedness; M&amp;A Transactions; and Initial Public Offerings. Students who complete this course will have a strong foundational understanding of the principal non-technology transactions that arise around high-growth/start-up firms and how they are structured and documented. They will be able to think through the principal legal issues that are likely to arise and formulate strategies in response.\"","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"Course taught through distance learning using video-conferencing from Cornell Tech.Â  Students who sign up for the class must commit to be in the class both semesters, fall and spring.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: LAW 6131.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":364156,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6514","titleShort":"Int'l Law & Foreign Legal Res","titleLong":"International and Foreign Legal Research","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16008,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:05AM","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"twm26","firstName":"Thomas","middleName":"W.","lastName":"Mills"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 277","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH277","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The practice of law continues to become ever more dependent upon a clear understanding of the global context in which it occurs.

The loftier aim, by contrast, is to investigate the many ways in which one's professional responsibilities might conflict with one's personal obligations, self-interest or moral ideals. What should a lawyer do when her professional duties conflict with her financial interests, obligations to friends or family, or her religious beliefs? Why might it be justified for a lawyer to defend a client she knows to be guilty? Is it an excuse that one was \"just following orders\"? We will investigate such questions by reading relevant legal opinions, as well as work by legal academics and moral philosophers. Students will take several smaller exams to test their mastery of central ethical rules governing the conduct of lawyers, and complete short writing assignments on the theoretical questions discussed in class.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":351622,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6791","titleShort":"Public International Law","titleLong":"Public International Law","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16035,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:10PM","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jdo43","firstName":"Jens","middleName":"David","lastName":"Ohlin"}],"pattern":"MTW","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall G90","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTHG90","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"An introduction to the legal rules governing the conduct of states vis-Ã -vis other states, individuals, and international organizations, with reference to major current events and issues.

Topics will include state constitutions, the rights that they confer, and their methods of interpretation; local government boundary formation and boundary change; state and local service, police, and taxing powers; the emergence of supra-local (regional) government; and the place of state and local governments in the federal system (including commerce clause, privileges and immunities clause, and taxation issues). The final part of the course will consider several areas of recent and future litigation - such as the interstate validity of gay marriages and federal challenges to states' medical and health reforms - as a way to illustrate the difficult issues of conflicting sovereignty that this area of law presents.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":351949,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6871","titleShort":"Supervised Writing","titleLong":"Supervised Writing","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":16049,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"602","classNbr":16050,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"603","classNbr":16051,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"Arrange directly with instructor.

Particular attention will be paid to the question of jurisdiction over international crimes. It will consider international crimes such as aggression; war crimes, crimes against humanity, terrorism, and torture. It will also consider the treatment of past human rights violations in post conflict situations. It will further consider procedural aspects of international criminal law and the forums that deal with international crimes. In that context, it will look at the structure, jurisdiction and jurisprudence of Truth Commissions; the International Criminal Court (The Rome Statute); the former Yugoslavia Tribunal; Rwanda Tribunal and extradition and mutual legal assistance. The format will be class discussions of assigned readings.

This year, the colloquium will focus on the topic of \"law and justice.\" The course will begin with three weeks of seminar designed to apprise students of existing work in law and the humanities and to situate current developments within this broader frame, concentrating on the often complicated relationship between law and justice. We will examine, for example, debates about voting, trial procedure, the prison system, citizenship, and other aspects of democratic process. After the introductory sessions, the remainder of the course will be organized around a series of speakers, some drawn from Cornell and some from other universities.

A central theme will be the question whether and to what degree welfare, well-being, and wealth for that matter can be understood apart from and even as determinative of normative propriety (\"rightness\" and \"wrongness\"), or whether instead these concepts presuppose a prior conception of normative propriety.

These clients will typically have represented themselves pro se in Immigration Court. During the first part of the semester students will learn substantive and procedural asylum and Convention Against Torture (CAT) law, such as the nature of persecution, grounds for asylum and CAT claims, and the practical and social effects that these laws have on new immigrants who seek asylum or CAT relief. Classes may also cover practical knowledge needed for effective representation, such as advanced research and writing skills. During the second part of the semester, students will work in teams of two on appellate briefs. These briefs will not only entail serious legal analysis, but may also require sociocultural and political research, so that the students can effectively write about the conditions of the client's home country. Students will interview clients over the phone during this time, with the possibility of face-to-face interviews. Some clients may be incarcerated, and many will be out-of-state.

Students will take part in the entire estate planning process from the initial informational intake meeting, to the preparation of the client's estate planning documents, to discussing the drafts with the clients along with addressing their comments and changes and to preparing and assisting with the execution of the client's estate planning documents. To further enhance the learning experience, lectures will be provided on the fundamentals of estate planning from establishing a healthy attorney-client relationship, drafting considerations for the client's last will and testament, basic related estate and income tax issues, ethical issues and the administration of the client's estate upon death.

Students who wish to apply to the clinic should submit a resume, transcript, and short statement of interest (no more than two pages) to Prof. Lyon. For more information about the clinic, email Prof. Lyon (beth.lyon@cornell.edu) and schedule a meeting. This course requires off premises travel to meet with clients and participate in hearings. Employment on a farm is one of the worlds' most difficult and dangerous occupations. Farmworkers experience geographic, linguistic, and cultural isolation, separation from family, immigration insecurity reinforced by policing practices, workplace sexual violence, and exclusion from protective employment laws. Working with the new clinic's community partners, Farmworker Legal Assistance Clinic I student attorneys will handle immigration and employment matters on behalf of farmworkers in the region, work that will typically involve negotiation and often require litigation. Students will also work in brief advice and referral outreach sessions in farmworker communities. Clinic participants may also have the opportunity to work on research and writing projects with civil rights, environmental protection, and farmworker rights organizations. Farmworker Clinic students will participate in a lawyering seminar and work with a clinic partner on their assigned cases. The lawyering seminar will focus on skills students need for effective client representation. Students will develop key lawyering skills, including interviewing, counseling, fact investigation, drafting, negotiation, language accessible practice, and, in some cases, trial advocacy.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-CEL)","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":367664,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7858","titleShort":"Farmworker Leg.

Students are introduced to the models of mediation and the benefits and challenges of each, including a comparative analysis of evaluative, facilitative and transformative styles of mediation. In the second segment, students will examine the impact of federal and state laws on the process. Significant attention will be devoted to the use of mediation in the public and federal sectors and in public sector negotiation impasses. The course will also explore the use of mediation across industries, including construction, securities, and commercial disputes.Â  The role of gender, race, culture, ethics and impasse in mediation will all be examined and incorporated into workshops and case studies. Through a series of workshops, students will have several opportunities to apply their knowledge of mediation and begin to develop the skills needed to become effective mediators. Students will be required to submit a final paper to complete the course requirements.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the writing requirement.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":352332,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"4051","titleShort":"The Death Penalty in America","titleLong":"The Death Penalty in America","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17503,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jb94","firstName":"John","middleName":"H.","lastName":"Blume"},{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"slj8","firstName":"Sheri","middleName":"Lynn","lastName":"Johnson"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 390","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH390","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The death penalty has gotten increased media attention due to high profile death row exonerations, and has long been under siege for other reasons, such as racial disparities in its imposition and the prevalence of very poor representation by defense counsel. This course surveys the legal and social issues that arise in the administration of the death penalty. The reading will be largely comprised of reported death penalty cases, but will be augmented by a variety of other sources, including empirical studies of the death penalty and the litigation experience of the professors. Although the focus will be on capital punishment as practiced in the United States, we will also consider international and comparative perspectives. Guest speakers will provide a range of views, and law students with experience working on capital cases will lead discussion sections.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: undergraduates only.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":362619,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"4131","titleShort":"Nature Functions Limits of Law","titleLong":"The Nature, Functions, and Limits of Law","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17452,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dmc66","firstName":"Dawn","middleName":"Michelle","lastName":"Chutkow"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 184","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH184","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3131","type":"C"},{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"3131","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"A general-education course to acquaint students with how our legal system pursues the goals of society.

course designed to introduce first-year students to lawyering skills, with primary emphasis on legal writing, analysis, research, and oral presentations. Assignments are usually set in the context of a simulated law office (or judge's chambers). In the fall semester, students write predictive memoranda that point out the strengths and weaknesses of their client's case. To prepare the memoranda, students may need to determine the facts of the case by conducting interviews or depositions. Acting as junior attorneys, students will also make an oral presentation to a supervising attorney. The spring semester focuses on persuasive advocacy. Students prepare a memorandum, motion, or brief for submission to a court and, later, orally argue for their positions in a simulated court session.

Arizona decision as it has evolved over time.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":351918,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6301","titleShort":"Directed Reading","titleLong":"Directed Reading","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"201","classNbr":17748,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["DIS"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"202","classNbr":17749,"meetings":[],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["DIS"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"An examination of a topic through readings selected by arrangement between the instructor and an individual student or group of students (not exceeding eight).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"Arrange directly with instructor.

It has two aimsâone immediate, the other more lofty. The immediate aim is to help prepare students for the MPRE. The loftier aim, by contrast, is to investigate the ways in which one's professional responsibilities might conflict with one's personal obligations or self-interest, and to consider the societal implications of the regulatory regime governing lawyers. What should a lawyer do when her professional duties conflict with her financial interests or obligations to friends or family? How does the legal profession's monopoly on the right to give legal advice shape the justice system? We will investigate such questions by reading relevant legal materials as well as work by legal academics.

Social science research is also used as a tool in law reform. The aim of the course is to develop a critical analysis of these uses of social science in law and litigation.

Topics will include state constitutions, the rights that they confer, and their methods of interpretation; local government boundary formation and boundary change; state and local service, police, and taxing powers; the emergence of supra-local (regional) government; and the place of state and local governments in the federal system (including commerce clause, privileges and immunities clause, and taxation issues). The final part of the course will consider several areas of recent and future litigation - such as the interstate validity of gay marriages and federal challenges to states' medical and health reforms - as a way to illustrate the difficult issues of conflicting sovereignty that this area of law presents.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":351949,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6871","titleShort":"Supervised Writing","titleLong":"Supervised Writing","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":17797,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"602","classNbr":17798,"meetings":[],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"603","classNbr":17799,"meetings":[],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"Arrange directly with instructor.

The focus of the seminar will be on the issues and dilemmas confronting China's ideal of empowering its state and people through the use of law. Topics will include the rule of law vs. the rule of Li (rituals and gifts), individual rights vs. collective interests, preference of informal justice over formal justice, cultivation of citizenship, growth of civil society, and the role of law in promoting the rights and interests of women, ethnic minority groups and disabled persons, and facilitating economic development. Interdisciplinary approaches will be employed in this seminar to facilitate understanding of Chinese legal tradition and its modern transformations, which include the efforts since the late 19th century of borrowing Western law and institutions and implementing current law reforms in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Readings are drawn from English translations of Chinese codes, cases and literary works, and academic writings by Western and Chinese scholars.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the writing requirement.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":365562,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7146","titleShort":"Comparative Legal Philosophy","titleLong":"Comparative Legal Philosophy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17880,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"xy64","firstName":"Xingzhong","middleName":"","lastName":"Yu"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 279","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH279","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar introduces students to the philosophy of law from a comparative perspective, focusing on such topics as the concept of law, the nature of judicial reasoning, theories of justice and righteousness,morality and religion, rights and obligations, and theories of rewarding and punishment.

We then proceed to apply these analytical structures to various substantive areas of law of particular concern to women, including but not limited to rape and other types of violence against women; pornography; prostitution; abortion, surrogacy and other reproductive rights issues.

This colloquium will bring together scholars working at the forefront of legal history, law and literature, law and culture, and critical theory from the institutional vantage points of both law and the humanities. This year, the colloquium will focus on the topic of \"law and justice.\" The course will begin with three weeks of seminar designed to apprise students of existing work in law and the humanities and to situate current developments within this broader frame, concentrating on the often complicated relationship between law and justice. We will examine, for example, debates about voting, trial procedure, the prison system, citizenship, and other aspects of democratic process. After the introductory sessions, the remainder of the course will be organized around a series of speakers, some drawn from Cornell and some from other universities. Students will be required to write six three- to five-page papers responding to the speakers' pre-circulated talks.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the writing requirement.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":363512,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7580","titleShort":"Markets, Morals and Methods","titleLong":"Markets, Morals, and Methods","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17903,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rch37","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"C.","lastName":"Hockett"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 279","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH279","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"04/27/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar is devoted to the foundations of choice, agency, and welfare -- matters that lie at the core of normative legal and economic theory. Readings, guest speakers, and class discussion will focus on the nature of preferences, reasons, and norms, as well as (a) their inter-relations and (b) their roles in guiding human decision and action. A central theme will be the question whether and to what degree welfare, well-being, and wealth for that matter can be understood apart from and even as determinative of normative propriety (\"rightness\" and \"wrongness\"), or whether instead these concepts presuppose a prior conception of normative propriety. Many legal and economic theorists seem to assume the former, but this assumption can -- and in this course will -- be examined critically.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the writing requirement.","catalogPermission":"Limited enrollment.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":351537,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"9901","titleShort":"Graduate Research","titleLong":"Graduate Research","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"RSC","ssrComponentLong":"Research","section":"701","classNbr":17843,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/22/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":12,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["RSC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: J.S.D.
