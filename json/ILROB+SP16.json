to be a Cornellian and engaged in campus life and the world beyond? Culture defines who we are as a member of Cornell University and how we should act toward one another and in the wider world. This course will examine the concept of culture and apply it to our role as Cornellians. Values matter. They tell us what is important in our lives. Effective leaders use culture to strengthen members' commitment to the organization and keep members focused on the organization's goals. In that sense, culture is a powerful form of social control that can be utilized to encourage and discourage specific behaviors. As an institution, Cornell University espouses values that all Cornellians believe in. Academic excellence, collective and individual responsibility, philanthropy, and fairness are a few that come to mind. While such values are central to Cornell, powerful voices have characterized student culture by a variety of negative terms, including \"binge drinking,\" \"sexual violence,\" and \"hazing.\" Cornellians do not condone such behaviors and most students act responsibly. Indeed, understanding the concept of culture and how student leaders use it to promote commitment can go a long way toward deterring these problems and managing the minority of students who engage in such unwanted behavior.

We will first review the literature on women in management, leadership, and entrepreneurship. We will then cover a blend of classic and contemporary feminist perspectives on organizations to understand the evolution of feminist thought in the field of OB and to analyze how both traditional and feminist approaches can inform research and practice.\nThe major goals of this course are to provide students with 1) an overview of gender research in the field of organizational behavior 2) to increase their understanding of how different feminist perspectives can inform research and practice 3) to support them in generating new questions, models and/or frameworks that can be used by organizations.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":367810,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILROB","catalogNbr":"7730","titleShort":"The Psychology of Org Change","titleLong":"The Psychology of Organizational Change","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17602,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"05:25PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"so44","firstName":"Shaul","middleName":"","lastName":"Oreg"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 116","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS116","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This is a research seminar, designed to examine and analyze research of resistance to change. Our focus will be the psychology of organizational change, examining research on change from the perspective of the change recipient.

The emphasis in the seminar will be on understanding and developing theoretical formulations of responses to change and on the design of research on these responses.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":355616,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILROB","catalogNbr":"9200","titleShort":"Organizl Behavr Workshop","titleLong":"Organizational Behavior Workshop","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":14447,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"omk4","firstName":"Olga","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Khessina"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This workshop is designed to provide a forum for the presentation of current research undertaken by faculty members and graduate students in the Department of Organizational Behavior and by invited guests.
