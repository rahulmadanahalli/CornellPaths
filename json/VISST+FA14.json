But how did these images affect the roles that black men and women played on and off the screen and the portrayal of the black body in contemporary society? This interdisciplinary course explores the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in addressing the body in art, film, photography and the media.

We will analyze a range of visual material, including textiles, paintings, photographs, and even tourist brochures to understand the dynamics of image-making and image consumption in the Andes. Given the seminar's broad temporal scope, we will embark on a series of case studies that serve to contextualize each historical moment of artistic production, from the Inca and colonial periods to the postcolonial period spanning the 19th century to the present. The final section of the course focuses on the politics of marketing \"Andeanness\" to contemporary audiences through museum displays, folkloric performances, and tourism.

With internationalization policies and the effects of globalization, the island has undergone further rapid and dramatic transformations since the 2000s.
