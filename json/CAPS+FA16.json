How did the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)—which was made up of but a few dozen members at its founding in 1921—come to rule over China in 1949 and hold on to the reins of government since? This course considers the history of Chinese communism from its origins in the aftermath of the First World War up to the present. In following the CCP along its road to revolution and through its decades in power, we chart the ways in which Chinese communism shaped and shifted the dynamics between state and society in China's tumultuous twentieth century. At the same time, we explore how Chinese communism as an ideological and institutional force influenced and was, in turn, influenced by various global currents and movements, from Cold War politics to radical agrarian insurgencies. This course will equip students to critically engage with questions of revolution, governance, and the place of China in the world today.

Such separation has then only been somewhat modified by the set of economic reforms that Deng Xiaoping first instituted in the late 1970s.  In this lecture we will seek to turn such conventional wisdom on its head through examining \"what China is\" via a consideration of transnational currents within the country's development. However, the course's primary focus will not be upon the past, but rather the present and attempting to determine just where the point of intersection between China and the rest of the world is. Coming to terms with such an issue will provide those who enroll in the class with a deeper, more nuanced, understanding of China's rise and this trend's implications for the rest of the world. We will accomplish this task through a combination of surveying the existing literature on China and transnational politics, and considering new theoretical perspectives on both.\n ","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"(IR)","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":359182,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"CAPS","catalogNbr":"4010","titleShort":"Honors Essay Tutorial I","titleLong":"Honors Thesis Tutorial I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":6458,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"xx12","firstName":"Xu","middleName":"","lastName":"Xin"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"BMT","gradingBasisShort":"Multi-Term","gradingBasisLong":"Multi-Term Course: Not Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Honors students conduct research to prepare a thesis on a topic of their own choosing under the direction of a faculty member. The application must be successfully submitted and an Honors Committee formed by the end of applicant's junior year in order for the student to be an honors candidate.

While China may not necessarily be the sole determinant of the type of security order that will prevail in Asia, it has a profound influence on the region and potentially on the global order as well. To gain an understanding of security issues in Asia today, the seminar attempts to come to terms with the evolving nature of China's foreign policy and national security strategies. The course then concentrates on the most influential academic work on China's foreign relations and national security policies that has been published since the end of the Cold War.\n ","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":352462,"crseOfferNbr":5,"subject":"CAPS","catalogNbr":"4998","titleShort":"Pol&Policy:Theory Res&Pract","titleLong":"Politics and Policy: Theory, Research, and Practice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"080","classNbr":6772,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:00AM","timeEnd":"12:20PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":10,"netid":"ds90","firstName":"David","middleName":"","lastName":"Silbey"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in Washington, DC."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"DC","locationDescr":"Washington, DC","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":8,"unitsMaximum":8,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This required course forms the core of the Cornell in Washington program for students in the public policy option. The central course objective is to provide students with the instruction and guidance necessary to analyze and evaluate their own chosen issue in public policy. Toward that end, the course has three components: (1) weekly lectures providing background on the structures and processes of national politics and policy as well as training in research methodology; (2) student externships; and (3) individual research papers or projects. All three components interrelate so as to provide students with a strategy and framework for integrating classroom based learning, field experience and individual research.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":362734,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"CAPS","catalogNbr":"4999","titleShort":"CAPS Independent Study","titleLong":"CAPS Independent Study","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":7025,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Independent study course in topics not covered in regularly scheduled courses.
