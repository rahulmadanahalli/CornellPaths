Genetic engineering (recombinant DNA technology) is one class of methods used in biotechnology. Private sector firms are actively marketing transgenic crops and other products of biotechnology globally. The public sector has been somewhat less active, but is becoming increasingly involved in transgenic technologies, particularly in less-industrialized countries. Developmental questions begin with those we ask of all technology: at whose cost, to whose benefit? Social movements have arisen to block both the testing and commercializing of biotechnology products, arguing that the developmental consequences are negative. Their objections center on the issues of food sovereignty, effects of land use change on the environment, ownership of transgenic traits and the genetic background in which they are placed (intellectual property), environmental uncertainties/risks, control of the food supply by multinational corporations and human health issues. Students will evaluate the legitimacy of various arguments and political positions relative to scientific findings and cultural norms.

Student teams will address complex interdisciplinary questions of sustainability by working collaboratively with an identified practitioner who is directly involved in the case study project being examined. This will ensure that classroom activities address actual constraints and problems being faced by local people associated with each case.

The class will expose students to a community that has rejected the prospect of open-pit mining, and instead attempted to create an alternative model of development focusing on artisan cooperatives, conservation initiatives, and sustainable agriculture. A series of guest lecturers from a wide range of disciplines will contextualize the case-study by addressing issues of sustainable development, community-based conservation, and resistance to extractive industries. Students will communicate directly with practitioners in Ecuador during the Fall semester and develop projects with their practitioners. Students will be able to choose between three topics: Design and Marketing for Artisanal Women's Groups, Agroforestry and Ecoagriculture for a Shade-Grown Coffee Cooperative, and Ecological Conservation and Reserve Management for a local conservation.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: IARD 4011 or LATA 4011.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Taking both IARD 4011 and IARD 6011 satifies diversity requirement for CALS.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AG","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":355244,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"IARD","catalogNbr":"6020","titleShort":"Agric. in the Devel.

Private sector firms are actively marketing transgenic crops and other products of biotechnology globally. The public sector has been somewhat less active, but is becoming increasingly involved in transgenic technologies, particularly in less-industrialized countries. Developmental questions begin with those we ask of all technology: at whose cost, to whose benefit? Social movements have arisen to block both the testing and commercializing of biotechnology products, arguing that the developmental consequences are negative. Their objections center on the issues of food sovereignty, effects of land use change on the environment, ownership of transgenic traits and the genetic background in which they are placed (intellectual property), environmental uncertainties/risks, control of the food supply by multinational corporations and human health issues.

The class will expose students to a community that has rejected the prospect of open-pit mining, and instead attempted to create an alternative model of development focusing on artisan cooperatives, conservation initiatives, and sustainable agriculture. A series of guest lecturers from a wide range of disciplines will contextualize the case-study by addressing issues of sustainable development, community-based conservation, and resistance to extractive industries. Students will communicate directly with practitioners in Ecuador during the Fall semester and develop projects with their practitioners.
