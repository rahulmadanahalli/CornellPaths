It consists of four parts. The first part deals with individual choices under uncertainty, including expected utility theory, risk aversion, stochastic dominance, and two-period consumption-portfolio problems. The second part deals with equilibrium pricing theories, including implications of no arbitrage and stochastic discount factor, risk sharing, aggregation, and consumption-based pricing in complete markets, mean-variance efficiency and the Capital Asset Pricing Model, and the Arbitrage Pricing Theory. We also explore the relation between these various pricing theories, and extend the treatment of individual consumption/portfolio problems and equilibrium pricing to a multi-period setting. In the third part, we review recent development in asset pricing by introducing some stylized facts and new theories. The fourth part gives a brief introduction to behavioral finance.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":365183,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NRE","catalogNbr":"5150","titleShort":"PhD Sem - Behavioral Decision","titleLong":"PhD Seminar - Behavioral Decision Making","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16499,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"05:40PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jer9","firstName":"J.","middleName":"","lastName":"Russo"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 131","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH131","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Add/Drop Dates:  Non-Johnson Students ONLY:  January 13th at 8:00am to February 4th at 4:00pm.

Recent topics have included: affect in decision making, attention (allocation and focus), coherence/consistency of beliefs, fluency, goals, individual differences, information distortion, memory, methods, neuroscience, non-conscious processes, self-control-regulatory focus-ego depletion, and System 1 versus System 2. Students taking this course for credit are expected (a) to lead the discussions for several of the weekly topics, including the selection of the articles assigned as readings and the development of study questions and (b) to prepare a final paper that is presented in preliminary oral form during one of the last class meetings. The paper can review a body of literature, present a new theory or framework, or report an original experiment (or only a proposal for an experiment).

This entails reading many seminal pieces and several broad overview articles that will cover the classic areas of research in the field. We will also read more cutting-edge papers that reanalyze and reframe many of the classic variables of micro-OB, trying to alter the dominant perspective, bring in new theory, and integrate conflicting approaches. Be forewarned that achievement of these course objectives will require a significant, yet manageable, amount of reading. It is critical that you read the assigned materials before class and spend some time thinking about the implications of the readings, both separately and as a collection.

Students taking this course for credit are expected (a) to lead the discussions for several of the weekly topics, including the selection of the articles assigned as readings and the development of study questions and (b) to prepare a final paper that is presented in preliminary oral form during one of the last class meetings. The paper can review a body of literature, present a new theory or framework, or report an original experiment (or only a proposal for an experiment).

It consists of three parts. The first part covers arbitrage pricing theory, including the Black Scholes Merton, the Heath Jarrow Morton, and reduced form credit risk models. The second part covers portfolio theory, in both complete and incomplete markets.

It is intended for doctoral students who wish to learn the academic field and its current developments. It is also designed to help students learn to use the ideas of the field in research projects of their own design. We will focus on theoretically driven contemporary research, especially that originating in Sociology and appearing in the major journals of Sociology and Management. We will examine the major theoretical perspectives and their current applications. We will also examine some active topical areas. Organization theory has grown to be a massive area, with many applications in related areas. Our focus in the course will be on basic questions about the structure and functioning of organizations: What do organizations look like? How do organizations behave? Why? The main goal of the course is to familiarize you with dominant theoretical perspectives as well as several current research streams and debates; the readings were chosen accordingly.

This entails reading some seminal pieces and broad overview articles that will cover the classic areas of research in the field. We will also read new research papers hot off the press and cutting-edge papers that reanalyze and reframe many of the classic variables of micro-OB, trying to alter the dominant perspective, bring in new theory, and integrate conflicting approaches. Be forewarned that achievement of these course objectives will require a significant, yet manageable, amount of reading. It is critical that you read the assigned materials before class and spend some time thinking about the implications of the readings, both separately and as a collection. We will use these readings to gain a sense of the theoretical progress of and diversity in the field, not as a set of findings that are simply to be digested or summated.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":365182,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NRE","catalogNbr":"5280","titleShort":"PhD Sem in Emp.

Students taking this course for credit are expected (a) to lead the discussions for several of the weekly topics, including the selection of the articles assigned as readings and the development of study questions and (b) to prepare a final paper that is presented in preliminary oral form during one of the last class meetings. The paper can review a body of literature, present a new theory or framework, or report an original experiment (or only a proposal for an experiment).

It consists of three parts. The first part covers arbitrage pricing theory, including the Black Scholes Merton, the Heath Jarrow Morton, and reduced form credit risk models. The second part covers portfolio theory, in both complete and incomplete markets. The third part studies equilibrium pricing models, both complete and incomplete markets, including the notion of market efficiency. This course emphasizes continuous time models and it is based on the use of martingales to understand asset pricing theory. Included in the course is the extensions of the standard theories to include asset price bubbles.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU","roster":"FA18"}]
