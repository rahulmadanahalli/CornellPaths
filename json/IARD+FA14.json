Genetic engineering (recombinant DNA technology) is one class of methods used in biotechnology. Private sector firms are actively marketing transgenic crops and other products of biotechnology globally. The public sector has been somewhat less active, but is becoming increasingly involved in transgenic technologies, particularly in less-industrialized countries. Developmental questions begin with those we ask of all technology: at whose cost, to whose benefit? Social movements have arisen to block both the testing and commercializing of biotechnology products, arguing that the developmental consequences are negative. Their objections center on the issues of food sovereignty, effects of land use change on the environment, ownership of transgenic traits and the genetic background in which they are placed (intellectual property), environmental uncertainties/risks, control of the food supply by multinational corporations and human health issues. Students will evaluate the legitimacy of various arguments and political positions relative to scientific findings and cultural norms.
