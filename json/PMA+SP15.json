At the same time, students will develop their critical, creative, and persuasive writing skills through peer and instructor review and a multi-draft essay process.

This specialized course takes students through a broad yet interconnected range of themes including racial formation and choreography theory, whiteness, Black dancing bodies, Latinidad, choreographing Asian America, and indigenous dance. Throughout the course students engage in interdisciplinary discussions on the racialized body, close readings of dance texts, and analyses of performances.

How have thinkers ranging from ancient and modern philosophers to contemporary critical theorists conceptualized animated-ness as essence, feeling, form, or intensity? What relationship(s) between bios and zoe may be understood through the analytic of animation? And how does animation clarify-or render less legible-distinctions among subjects, objects, and things? Answering these and related questions about reanimation, hyper-animation, inter(in)animation, and the uncanny, we also test theoretical ideas about states of animation against a number of performance and media practices. Authors include Agamben, Barthes, Benjamin, Eisenstein, Freud, Hansen, Kleist, Moten, Ngai, Schneider, and Sobchack.

agent in a democratic society.  The course includes readings from academic literatures in theater, political theory, educational philosophy, international and community development, adult education, history, American studies, planning, and social movements.  In addition, students complete writing assignments, engage in class discussions, listen to guest lectures, observe films and actively participate in performance and service-learning projects.  Through the use of democratic, critical and multicultural pedagogies, the course engages students in a variety of activities aimed at developing their knowledge and skills in active listening and dialogue across diverse perspectives, and in relationship building with their peers, the instructors, and community partners.  Course activities are process-oriented, drawing from theories of transformational and experiential learning that assist students in developing their abilities as self-directed, autonomous and socially responsible learners.  Students are required to co-facilitate class sessions with the instructors and share the responsibility for selecting appropriate learning objectives, content, process, format and activities.  They work in groups to identify and collaborate with community partners to plan, design, implement and evaluate a service-learning project.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with DSOC 4940 lecture

various moments in U.S. cultural history. Through the central trope of the \"sensing body,\" this course draws from interdisciplinary analytics-listening, voice, audio-vision, accent, soundtrack, to name a few-in order to investigate the role of popular music and performance in how race has been naturalized. This course pays particular attention to the relationship between live performances and the various recording and media technologies that have impacted a longer U.S. cultural history: the phonograph, radio, microphones, film soundtracks, television, YouTube, critical and creative writing. Course assignments include: short reading and listening responses, album/performance reviews, an annotated bibliography/discography, group blog project, and final research paper.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":367026,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"6435","titleShort":"Culture/Cinema/Sensation","titleLong":"Media Arts Laboratory: Culture/Cinema/Sensation","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16948,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"dka29","firstName":"Diana","middleName":"K.","lastName":"Allan"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jps378","firstName":"John","middleName":"Paul","lastName":"Sniadecki"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts SB12","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZSB12","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"4035","type":"B"},{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"7035","type":"B"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"4435","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":null,"catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":355388,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"6540","titleShort":"Introduction To Film Analysis","titleLong":"Introduction to Film Analysis: Meaning and Value","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":8710,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:35PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"crw225","firstName":"Chelsea","middleName":"R.","lastName":"Wessels"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts B21","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZB21","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"2540","type":"B"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"2174","type":"B"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"6174","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Intensive consideration of the ways films generate meaning and of the ways we attribute meaning and value to films.

How have thinkers ranging from ancient and modern philosophers to contemporary critical theorists conceptualized animated-ness as essence, feeling, form, or intensity? What relationship(s) between bios and zoe may be understood through the analytic of animation? And how does animation clarify-or render less legible-distinctions among subjects, objects, and things? Answering these and related questions about reanimation, hyper-animation, inter(in)animation, and the uncanny, we also test theoretical ideas about states of animation against a number of performance and media practices. Authors include Agamben, Barthes, Benjamin, Eisenstein, Freud, Hansen, Kleist, Moten, Ngai, Schneider, and Sobchack.
