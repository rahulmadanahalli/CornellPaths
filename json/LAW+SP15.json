This course surveys the legal and social issues that arise in the administration of the death penalty. The reading will be largely comprised of reported death penalty cases, but will be augmented by a variety of other sources, including empirical studies of the death penalty and the litigation experience of the professors. Although the focus will be on capital punishment as practiced in the United States, we will also consider international and comparative perspectives. Guest speakers will provide a range of views, and law students with experience working on capital cases will lead discussion sections.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: undergraduates only.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":362619,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"4131","titleShort":"Nature Functions Limits of Law","titleLong":"The Nature, Functions, and Limits of Law","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17225,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dmc66","firstName":"Dawn","middleName":"Michelle","lastName":"Chutkow"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 184","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH184","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3131","type":"C"},{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"3131","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"A general-education course to acquaint students with how our legal system pursues the goals of society.

presentations. Assignments are usually set in the context of a simulated law office (or judge's chambers). In the fall semester, students write predictive memoranda that point out the strengths and weaknesses of their client's case. To prepare the memoranda, students may need to determine the facts of the case by conducting interviews or depositions. Acting as junior attorneys, students will also make an oral presentation to a supervising attorney. The spring semester focuses on persuasive advocacy. Students prepare a memorandum, motion, or brief for submission to a court and, later, orally argue for their positions in a simulated court session. Throughout the year, students also learn the fundamentals of legal research. Instruction occurs not only in full-class sessions but also in individual conferences. Students receive extensive feedback on each major assignment.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.

Thus, the course includes a discussion of the following topics: economic development and foreign capital; obstacles to the flow of investments to developing countries; guarantees to investors and investment codes; bilateral treaties; nationalization; joint ventures; project financing; transfer of technology; arbitration; investment insurance; unification of trade law; and the settlement of investment disputes.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":363496,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6701","titleShort":"Legislation","titleLong":"Legislation","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17613,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:10PM","startDt":"01/20/2015","endDt":"04/24/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jc2284","firstName":"Josh","middleName":"","lastName":"Chafetz"}],"pattern":"MTW","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 277","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH277","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/20/2015","endDt":"04/24/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Much of the \"law\" that lawyers work with is statutory.

This course will review this development, its legal foundations and fundamental principles. It will outline the framework within which the principles and rules of international environmental law apply. The framework comprises the legal nature of states, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, treaties and other legal instruments such as UN resolutions. The course will consider the adequacy of this legal system in addressing regional and global needs to achieve sustainability. Critical aspects of sustainability include: climate change, increasing frequency and magnitude of disasters including droughts and floods, marine resources, energy, biodiversity, genetic resources and associated intellectual property issues, and trade and economic development.

Those who present materials will be asked to speak not only about their specific research but also to address where their work is situated within new developments in law and humanities as a whole.\nThe course will begin with three weeks of seminar designed to apprise students of the history of law and humanities to date and to situate current developments within this history. We will, for example, read classics of the law and literature movement by James Boyd White and Robert Cover, then inquire as to how recent work-such as the essays in Victoria Kahn and Lorna Hutson's collection Rhetoric and Law in Early Modern Europe-might differ in approach. The rest of the course will be organized around a series of speakers, some drawn from Cornell and some from other universities. The students will convene for a half hour at the beginning of the session, which will then be opened to a larger community, including faculty members, for the talk itself.\nStudents will be required to write six three- to five-page papers responding to the speakers' pre-circulated talks; these will be due in advance of the class session and shown to those lecturing in order to prompt and enhance discussion.

Some answer this question with a simple accusation that the system is racist in design and implementation, and point to familiar statistics to buttress their claim. African Americans are eight times more likely to be incarcerated than whites. As of 2004, over 12% of African American men between the ages of 25 and 29 were in custody. For under-educated young black men, the incarceration rates are simply astounding: in 2000, nearly one in five African-American men under 41 who had not attended college were in prison or jail. Yet these statistics, as dispiriting as they are, must open the debate, not end it. While no one credibly doubts the persistence of racially biased decision-making throughout the criminal justice system, careful empirical research strongly suggests that overt discrimination plays a relatively modest role in producing the current state of play. The explanations for the disparities that haunt the criminal justice system are nuanced and complex, and therefore deserving of careful study. Absorbing lessons from a wide variety of disciplines, including history, sociology, political science, economics, and law, this seminar will try to shed light on this vexing American problem. Attendance, preparation, and participation are mandatory. Because the literature on this topic is voluminous, the readings for each class will range across a wide field. I expect the time commitment to be substantial. Still, there are no special course requirements. Grades will be based on class participation (15%) and a research paper (85%) due at the end of term. As part of the course, I will try to arrange a tour of a Maximum Security Prison, the timing of which will be determined once registration is complete and we have a roster of students. To accommodate the visit, the reading schedule may be adjusted as needed.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Limited enrollment.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":367096,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7675","titleShort":"Issues in Financial Regulation","titleLong":"Issues in Financial Regulation","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17764,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"01/20/2015","endDt":"04/24/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sto24","firstName":"Saule","middleName":"T","lastName":"Omarova"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 276","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH276","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/20/2015","endDt":"04/24/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar will seek to introduce students to a broad range of legal and regulatory issues that arise in connection with, and as a result of, financial innovation and increasing globalization of financial markets and institutions.

Earlier that fall, the SS commandants, officers and guards who had been arrested by the British upon the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, had been tried before a British military tribunal.

Students may also locate expert and other witnesses, and draft affidavits and motions. The students' cases will provide a basis for more in-depth substantive learning, as well as practical skills and attorney-client issues. In class, each team will also discuss the legal and practice issues that arise in their case, so that all students can benefit from and assist with each individual case.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the skills requirement.","catalogPermission":"Limited enrollment.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":364872,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7805","titleShort":"Advanced Labor Law Clinic","titleLong":"Advanced Labor Law Clinic","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"CLN","ssrComponentLong":"Clinical","section":"301","classNbr":17760,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/20/2015","endDt":"04/24/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"abc49","firstName":"Angela","middleName":"B.","lastName":"Cornell"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/20/2015","endDt":"04/24/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["CLN"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The Advanced Labor Law Clinic provides students another opportunity to deepen their understanding of traditional labor and employment law by representing the interests of workers with typical workplace issues.

During the semester, there will likely be two guest speakers and two panel discussions on timely labor law topics, which students will be required to attend, along with weekly meetings to discuss case preparation and advancement.

Students develop skills such as interviewing, client counseling, fact-finding, legal research, brief-writing, negotiating on behalf of clients, and conducting hearings. Examples of individual litigation cases are: representing a lesbian woman seeking asylum from Jamaica based on her sexual orientation and assisting a transgender woman in a men's prison challenging the conditions of her confinement. Students will handle all stages of any legal proceedings in immigration court, state court, or other forums. Examples of advocacy projects include presenting a community education workshop in how LGBT seniors can protect their legal rights and writing a report on access to domestic violence shelters for LGBT domestic violence victims.
