Students will review the archaeological history of this coastal kingdom that has its roots deep in Levantine prehistory. Then we will study the textual material emerging from the thousands of clay tablets inscribed in alphabetic Ugaritic and cuneiform Babylonian that vividly illuminate matters of cult, economy, law, and daily life in a Late Bronze Age city during the 14th -12th centuries BCE. Students will read a sample of these texts, in translation or the original (for credit in 6644), to gain insights into the life of a cosmopolitan center that managed to thrive while surrounded by territorial\nempires during history's first truly international age.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":367332,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"7520","titleShort":"Jewish Cities","titleLong":"Jewish Cities","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16784,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"ejs362","firstName":"Elissa","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Sampson"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"4620","type":"B"},{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"7620","type":"B"},{"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"4520","type":"B"},{"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"6520","type":"B"},{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"4520","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"4520","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"7520","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Jews and cities have been shaping each other for thousands of years. Studying those interactions involves urbanism, cosmopolitanism, transnationalism, and the idea of \"the ghetto.\" This course ranges through time and space as we examine those fruitful and sometimes painful interactions by looking at labor, \"ethnicity\" and the built environment. Topics include contemporary Brooklyn, where Hasidic areas bump into hipster and black Caribbean communities; the place of Jews in medieval European cities; North African Jewish spaces between French colonizers and Muslim neighbors; the formation of the shtetl and the industrial town in Eastern Europe; memoirs of the golden age of Berlin Jewry; and the immigrant \"ghetto\" of the Lower East Side. We will focus closely on the involvement of urban Jewish communities in modernization and colonialism. Course materials include visual resources as well as historical, ethnographic and literary materials.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-ITL)","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":366855,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"7913","titleShort":"Walter Benjamin","titleLong":"Walter Benjamin","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15022,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jab857","firstName":"Jonathan","middleName":"Aaron","lastName":"Boyarin"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"4413","type":"B"},{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"7413","type":"B"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4429","type":"B"},{"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"4413","type":"B"},{"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"6413","type":"B"},{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"4913","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"4913","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"7913","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This extraordinary figure died in 1941, and his death is emblematic of the intellectual depradations of Nazism. Yet since World War II, his influence, his reputation, and his fascination for scholars in a wide range of cultural and political disciplines has steadily grown. He is seen as a bridging figure between German and Jewish studies, between materialist critique of culture and the submerged yet powerful voice of theology, between literary history and philosophy. We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"}]
