A variety of exercises use modern techniques in the field mapping of a broad range of variably deformed sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks. The course further provides an introduction to the tectonics and magmatic processes of the central Andes with emphasis on comparable processes in the United States. Exercises are done in combination with students and faculty of the University of Buenos Aires.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(PBS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: introductory geology course and EAS 4260, or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"EN"},{"strm":2594,"crseId":367462,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"EAS","catalogNbr":"4998","titleShort":"International Research Intern","titleLong":"International Research Intern","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"RSC","ssrComponentLong":"Research","section":"700","classNbr":1819,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"05/26/2015","endDt":"08/14/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ldb7","firstName":"Larry","middleName":"Douglas","lastName":"Brown"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

The goal of the course is to teach participants the skills needed to work independently to acquire data sets derived from a variety of satellite sensors (SeaWiFS, MODIS, AVHRR, SeaWinds and Topex-Poseidon) and to merge these data sets to examine biological response to changes in the physical environment. Course time is split equally between lectures and computer lab work. Lectures cover the fundamentals of bio-optics, pigment algorithms, primary production algorithms and the underlying physical principals leading to the measurement of sea surface temperature, ocean wind speed and ocean topography. Computer labs focus on developing the IDL (Research Systems, Inc.) programming skills needed to process, analyze and visualize satellite image data.
