Focus is on those collections that consist of replicas (e.g. musical instruments, Rau plow collection, plaster cast collection, Blaschka glass models of invertebrates). We will explore the collection's and their object's multiple temporalities, materiality and correspondent multi-disciplinarity. What purpose do/did these copies serve within a given discipline? How are they made to translate a prototype? How did/does this \"translation\" affect the way the very prototype was understood by different disciplines? The seminar hopes to make these collections relevant again to students and the university alike.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367336,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SHUM","catalogNbr":"4501","titleShort":"Lessons In The Anthropocene","titleLong":"Lessons In The Anthropocene","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17350,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"cac528","firstName":"Craig","middleName":"A.R.","lastName":"Campbell"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"A D White House 109","bldgDescr":"A D White House","facilityDescrshort":"ADW109","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"4051","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The seminar examines the idea of the \"end of time\" with particular attention given to the peoples and culture groups of the circumpolar subarctic and arctic.
