Kanesh and the rulers of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.  There is no continuous linguistic record of Assyrian, but scholars have identified three significant dialects (Old, Middle, and Neo-Assyrian) during the two millennia that it was used.  The primary goal of this course is to analyze each of these dialects, the ways that Assyrian differs from the other major branch of Akkadian, Babylonian, and the manners in which the language and script changed over time.  Students are expected to show progress in reading cuneiform script and competence in utilizing reference materials.  We will read the Middle Assyrian Laws, harem edicts, Assyrian letters from Anatolia, a coronation ritual, omen queries to the sun god, letters from the Assyrian state department, and texts involving Urartu, the
