These include (among others) customers, investors, employees, vendors, governments, local communities, and advocacy groups. Maintaining the trust of these constituencies is vital to effective management-and to the health of the company itself. Such trust is undermined by actions stakeholders perceive as unfair or even unethical. Hence, hospitality and tourism managers must be able to identify and resolve tough ethical challenges posed by conflicting stakeholder interests. Moreover, they need to be able to recognize biases and other psychological traps that can result in unethical actions that threaten stakeholder relationships. This discussion-oriented course aims both to sharpen students' skills in ethical reasoning and to help them avoid cognitive pitfalls that can lead to ethically defective decisions. Making use of a variety of relevant concepts and principles, class discussion will critically examine ethical issues confronting managers in the hospitality and tourism industry and explore how those issues might be handled in ethically defensible ways.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.

The intent of this course is to provide a cornerstone experience from which students can build their entrepreneurial education through other entrepreneurship courses.

The course will emphasize entrepreneurship as a manageable process that can be applied in virtually any organizational setting. Further, it is a course that mixes theory with practice, and you will be challenged to apply principles, concepts and frameworks to real world situations. Opportunity recognition is the very basis from which entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial activity begins. Research shows that opportunity recognition is a learned behavior and as such this course will also seek to provide students with a better understanding of opportunity recognition through an exploration of the skills, tools, and mindset to generate new business ideas.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.

This course is a practical seminar designed to teach students how to understand and use themselves well, cultivate and leverage a network of relationships, to lead others effectively, and navigate the politics of an organization. This immersive weekend experience is divided into two parts: developing a sound understanding of self and building a foundation for leadership. Each of the areas of instruction creates clear and powerful insight into cultivating an individual \"leadership point of view\" or personal philosophy for leadership. The concept of \"leadership point of view\" has been taught by instructors in some of the most prestigious organizations in the United States and beyond.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Elective.

The course will emphasize entrepreneurship as a manageable process that can be applied in virtually any organizational setting. Further, it is a course that mixes theory with practice, and you will be challenged to apply principles, concepts and frameworks to real world situations. Opportunity recognition is the very basis from which entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial activity begins.

The course will emphasize entrepreneurship as a manageable process that can be applied in virtually any organizational setting. Further, it is a course that mixes theory with practice, and you will be challenged to apply principles, concepts and frameworks to real world situations. Opportunity recognition is the very basis from which entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial activity begins.

Students also learn how to adjust their negotiating style to respond appropriately to others' different personalities and negotiation tactics.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"Elective.

The course will emphasize entrepreneurship as a manageable process that can be applied in virtually any organizational setting. Further, it is a course that mixes theory with practice, and you will be challenged to apply principles, concepts and frameworks to real world situations. Opportunity recognition is the very basis from which entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial activity begins.

This immersive weekend experience is divided into two parts: developing a sound understanding of self and building a foundation for leadership.

The intent of this course is to provide a cornerstone experience from which students can build their entrepreneurial education through other entrepreneurship courses. Entrepreneurship is approached as a way of thinking and acting, as an attitude and a behavior. The course will emphasize entrepreneurship as a manageable process that can be applied in virtually any organizational setting. Further, it is a course that mixes theory with practice, and you will be challenged to apply principles, concepts and frameworks to real world situations. Opportunity recognition is the very basis from which entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial activity begins. Research shows that opportunity recognition is a learned behavior and as such this course will also seek to provide students with a better understanding of opportunity recognition through an exploration of the skills, tools, and mindset to generate new business ideas.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall (weeks 8-14), spring (weeks 1-7).","catalogComments":"Elective.  Undergraduates must enroll in HADM 4144.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"HA","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":364855,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"HADM","catalogNbr":"6175","titleShort":"Career Planning in Hosp Indus","titleLong":"Career Planning for the Hospitality Industry","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16998,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"kmw33","firstName":"Kate","middleName":"","lastName":"Walsh"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Statler Hall 341","bldgDescr":"Statler Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STL341","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Enrollment limited to: MMH students.

The usual add/drop policy applies, and retroactive credit for work commenced after an academic semester has ended is not allowed. Projects are conducted under the direction of a faculty member, and regular, frequent consultations are mandatory. Also, a written report must be produced and made available to all faculty members and students of the school after its submission to the supervising faculty member. Up to 3 credits for independent study projects may not count toward the SHA elective requirements. Any over 3 credits will be free electives only. Students cannot earn academic credit for independent study when the equivalent material is offered in a regular course, and credit is not earned for teaching a course.

provides students with the theoretical lenses and interpersonal skills required to become effective leaders of themselves and others at all organizational levels. With a particular emphasis on the hospitality industry, students develop an understanding and appreciation of the complexities of leading and managing individuals, teams and organizations, and acquire practical tools for accomplishing personal leadership and organizational goals within a service-based framework. Topics include understanding individual differences, leveraging conflict management, applying team-based problem-solving, understanding power and influence dynamics, principles of motivation, coaching and leadership, understanding of group process, and ethics.  The course emphasizes practical application of all concepts to students' personal and professional lives and goals, with particular emphasis on work-life in hospitality and broadly, service contexts. Students learn through the use of case studies, self-assessments, experiential exercises, readings, discussions, papers, and group activities.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"Required.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["PLO 1.1: Students will identify key issues and appropriately apply discipline principles to analyze a hospitality management solution.","PLO 1.2: Students will critically evaluate a hospitality management problem and will formulate a solution based on principles from at least two management disciplines.","PLO 2.3: Students will demonstrate productive team behaviors.","PLO 3.1: Students will identify the ethical dimensions of a business decision.","PLO 4.1: Students will describe their personal strengths and development needs related to hospitality management.","PLO 4.2: Students will identify the personal goals and learning opportunities required for continued personal and professional development."],"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"HA","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":351502,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"HADM","catalogNbr":"1210","titleShort":"Financial Accounting","titleLong":"Financial Accounting","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13434,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mm2549","firstName":"Mary","middleName":"","lastName":"MacAusland"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Statler Hall 398","bldgDescr":"Statler Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STL398","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Enrollment limited to: SHA students."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"002","classNbr":13435,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mm2549","firstName":"Mary","middleName":"","lastName":"MacAusland"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Statler Hall 398","bldgDescr":"Statler Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STL398","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Enrollment limited to: SHA students."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"An introduction to financial accounting that studies transaction analysis, the balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, and the statement of stockholder's equity.

Topics include information and information management in organizations; fundamentals of relational database design and implementation; writing and running SQL queries; working in database design teams and as individual research analysts; database design and management using Microsoft Access; database normalization; data-driven decision making; conversion of data into information and knowledge that can be leveraged to achieve business objectives; the role of data and information management in contemporary society; and data management opportunities in the hospitality industry.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Elective.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"HA","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":367947,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"HADM","catalogNbr":"4055","titleShort":"Hosp, Health & Design Industry","titleLong":"Hospitality, Health and Design Industry Immersion Seminar","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":13643,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:05AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"rbh25","firstName":"Brooke","middleName":"","lastName":"Hollis"},{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"mms449","firstName":"Mardelle","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Shepley"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rv54","firstName":"Rohit","middleName":"","lastName":"Verma"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Statler Hall 398","bldgDescr":"Statler Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STL398","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Limited to juniors and seniors.
