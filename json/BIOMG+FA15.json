Topics include transmission of genes and chromosomes, sex determination, and chromosomal abnormalities. Students will analyze and discuss problems and case studies using classical pedigree analysis and probability theory. They will acquire sufficient understanding the functions of DNA, RNA and proteins and the technologies for analyzing them to be able to participate in class discussions, concerning the human genome project, genomics, including personal genomics, and ethical implications for human society. The class will meet three times a week with two lecture style presentations and one session devoted to active participatory discussion of emerging social issues related to human genetics and genomics. Outside speakers will be brought in for some of these sessions.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(PBS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["After successfully completing BIOMG 1150, students should be able to:  Explain, evaluate and effectively interpret factual claims, theories and assumptions in the student's discipline(s).","Integrate both qualitative and quantitative evidence to draw conclusions about the potential mode of inheritance of genes and phenotypes and reach defensible conclusions on these topics.","Find, access, critically evaluate and ethically use information related to human inheritance.","Communicate effectively on issues concerning genetics through writing, speech and the development of visual tools such as pedigrees.","Demonstrate the ability to work both independently and in groups to achieve the goals listed above."],"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":363586,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"BIOMG","catalogNbr":"1350","titleShort":"Intro Bio:Cell & Development","titleLong":"Introductory Biology: Cell and Developmental Biology","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":3956,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"tch4","firstName":"Tim","middleName":"Clark","lastName":"Huffaker"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Kennedy Hall 116-Call Aud","bldgDescr":"Kennedy Hall","facilityDescrshort":"KND116","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Biological science majors must take this course for a letter grade.

Extracting the most information from experimental data in BMCB often requires statistical methods beyond introductory statistics courses and standard \"black box\" software. For example, the appropriate use of lognormal distributions, Bayesian statistics, weighted error analysis, and simulations for hypothesis testing can significantly improve accuracy, particularly when the amount of data available is small. We will cover such methods, often in the context of case studies provided by the students, in four to six 1.5-hour sessions. Students should bring a relevant problem, data from their own research, and a laptop with Excel software, to the course."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"09/07/2015","endDt":"10/12/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Adv Stat Methods Expermnt BMCB"}],"unitsMinimum":0.5,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"7W1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"10/11/2015","sessionLong":"Seven Week - First"}],"description":"Lectures and seminars on specialized topics.
