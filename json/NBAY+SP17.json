They help you improve performance quickly and effectively, but one careless moment can cause irreparable damage and serious injury. This course encourages both deep skepticism about performance measures and pragmatic recognition of how useful they can be. Thoughtless adherence to performance measures leads many to decry \"bean counters,\" and emphasize that \"Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.\" Yet something gets counted whenever we need to make critical decisions throughout the workplace, politics and daily life. This course will help students interpret the performance measures generated by the managerial reporting systems most pervasive in modern organizations, design systems that generate more useful measures, and make better use those measures — even when what gets counted is but a misleading shadow of what counts.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: students at Cornell Tech.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":367145,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBAY","catalogNbr":"5180","titleShort":"Design Thinking","titleLong":"Design Thinking","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13346,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:30AM","timeEnd":"12:15PM","startDt":"01/24/2017","endDt":"02/23/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":12,"netid":"mtb242","firstName":"Marc","middleName":"Thomas","lastName":"Brudzinski"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in NYC.

Firms in creative industries, play a role in every aspect of our lives, and influence many physical and psychological aspects of our lives, from what we eat and wear to how we entertain ourselves, but markets for cultural goods are complex and difficult to navigate. Entrepreneurs must, therefore, understand the economic sociology of the cultural market and ecosystem in order to capture economic value, a process that recursively relates to cultural norms. At the same time, the creative industries are seen by some as the last frontier for technological innovations, where many of the gains made in other sectors by pioneering entrepreneurial leaders, have not yet been realized. This course will examine why this is the case by shedding light on the underlying economic, social, and cultural rules and norms that govern the structure and functioning of these markets, in order to derive strategies and business models for entrepreneurial success. These firms thus capture economic value by transforming cultural norms in ways that appear to, and sometimes do, change the way we think and live. This course will analyze business cases of such market-pioneers in a wide range of creative industries such as art, fashion, film, food, music, publishing, and theater to explore and understand the economic, organizational, and sociological underpinnings of entrepreneurship, value(s), markets, and culture.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: students at Cornell Tech.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":367049,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBAY","catalogNbr":"5920","titleShort":"ITrek Trip","titleLong":"ITrek Trip","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13340,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rm34","firstName":"Roni","middleName":"","lastName":"Michaely"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in Israel."}],"campus":"NYT","campusDescr":"New York Tech Campus","location":"OTHINTL","locationDescr":"OTHINTL","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Israel"}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, winter.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":367941,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBAY","catalogNbr":"6000","titleShort":"Tech Strategy","titleLong":"Tech Strategy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13398,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"04/10/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jsm448","firstName":"Juzar","middleName":"Saleh","lastName":"Motiwalla"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in NYC.

Sessions are devoted to the social and legal issues arising from the rapid advances in electronic communication. In attempting to predict the disruptive changes of the future, it is best to understand the technologies themselves.

More specific objectives are (1) To understand the critical role of framing, so that participants are able to structure their decisions in the most useful way(s) and to see how coworkers, competitors, and other stakeholders view the same decision situation. (2) To identify typical shortcomings in intuitive judgment and provide methods for overcoming these shortcomings. (3)To provide tools for managing group decisions.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":366813,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBAY","catalogNbr":"6660","titleShort":"Negotiations","titleLong":"Negotiations","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13330,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"04/10/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"yc659","firstName":"Ya-Ru","middleName":"","lastName":"Chen"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in NYC.

Why do we sometimes get our way while other times we walk away feeling frustrated by our inability to achieve the agreement we desire?","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368480,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBAY","catalogNbr":"6700","titleShort":"Leadership for Studio","titleLong":"Leadership for Studio","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17950,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:30PM","timeEnd":"06:30PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mvk34","firstName":"Mukti","middleName":"Vishvanath","lastName":"Khaire"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in NYC.
