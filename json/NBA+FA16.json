The second part focuses on more advanced financial statement topics and specialized industries. We cover investment research, accounting analysis, credit analysis, banking, mergers and acquisitions, and issues relating to international financial statement analysis. The course emphasizes the practical application of the material using a combination of lecture, cases, and hands-on examples.  Students are evaluated based on a project and two exams.  The course presumes an understanding of basic corporate finance theory and basic financial accounting, but little or no previous experience in security valuation.

Internally, leaders will need to be prepared to manage the organization's culture, establish a mission, and find synergies in pursuit of a triple bottom line. Externally, leaders must manage not only supply chain and customer relationships, but also seek to fundamentally change the social, environmental and legal environments in which business operates. A major focus of the course will be on the challenges associated with connecting social initiatives and missions with bottom‑line benefits. These include: How can the goals of a company be articulated in and driven by the corporate mission? How can leaders establish a mission that is big enough to attract employees, customers and partners but specific enough to be achievable? What does success look like for a social entrepreneur? And, which goals are established by the market and which by the mission?","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":350059,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5110","titleShort":"Financial Modeling","titleLong":"Financial Modeling","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"004","classNbr":13359,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dcn6","firstName":"David","middleName":"Craig","lastName":"Nichols"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B10","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB10","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"** This Section for Non-Johnson Grad, UG Srs/Jrs.

Do you want to learn how to write a long research paper? Do you not want to take a final examination? If so this course may be for you. Since the beginning of the republic, American intellectuals, politicians and businessmen have extolled the exceptionalism of America. In a world of diverse forms of capitalism, can this view be sustained? Is America a shining city on the hill or a darkened city in the valley? Comparison is an effective way to discern and assess what is unique and what is general in the distinctive form of America's capitalist democracy. In this course the liberal market economy of the United States with its distinctive strengths and weaknesses is put side-by-side with different forms of liberal, corporatist and statist market economies that characterize different European countries in the emerging European polity. The diversity of capitalism points to one overarching conclusion: all of these countries are arguably capitalist, democratic market economies belonging to \"the West;\" and each of them has distinctive strengths and weaknesses. Like all other countries, America is ordinary in mobilizing its formidable capacities and displaying its glaring weaknesses as it copes with change. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":350179,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5350","titleShort":"Fed Income Tax- Corp and Share","titleLong":"Federal Income Taxation of Corporations and Shareholders","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17518,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"10/07/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jwm336","firstName":"John","middleName":"W.","lastName":"McKinley"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Warren Hall B02","bldgDescr":"Warren Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WRNB02","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Co-meets with AEM 4560."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"10/07/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"7W1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"10/07/2016","sessionLong":"Seven Week - First"}],"description":"This course presents the tax skills necessary to make business decisions pertaining to corporations and their shareholders.  Emphasis is placed on such areas as a corporation's formation and capital structure, earnings and profits, dividend distributions, redemptions, liquidations and reorganizations of corporations.  Practical application of the tax law will be emphasized with proper consideration placed on the historical, economic and political perspectives of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":368230,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5355","titleShort":"Fed income Tax- Ent, Est, Trst","titleLong":"Federal Income Taxation of Flow Through Entities, Estates and Trusts","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17517,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jwm336","firstName":"John","middleName":"W.","lastName":"McKinley"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Warren Hall B02","bldgDescr":"Warren Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WRNB02","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Co-meets with AEM 4560.\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students August 16th thru September 6th with an additional Add/Drop period beginning October 12th at 8:00am to October 18th at 4:00pm. \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  October 15th at 8:00am to October 18th 4:00pm.

Topics considered here include swaps, credit derivatives, value at risk models, and systemic risk. Just as intermediation has moved from institutions to markets, the course follows a similar evolution in the topics studied over the course of the semester.

While it will start with an overview of the investment management industry, it will move quickly toward a review of the more recent growth in hedge funds. Given the attention that the investment management industry (not to mention the world at large) has put on hedge funds and the relatively unregulated and secretive nature of the breed, the course will seek to answer the question of what exactly is going on in the industry and where it is going. The intention will be to give students an overview of the hedge fund space from the perspective of what comprises it, who the participants are (managers, investors, support areas, and intermediaries), how hedge funds are assessed and measured both individually and in portfolio, how investors access hedge funds, and what major issues face the industry.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":350242,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5540","titleShort":"International Finance","titleLong":"International Finance","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13332,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"wbb1","firstName":"Warren","middleName":"B.","lastName":"Bailey"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B10","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB10","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"**Open to Johnson and Graduate Students Only\nPre-req: NCC 5060 or NCC 5560\nNO DROPS WILL BE ALLOWED AFTER THE LAST DAY OF ADD/DROP Instructor will NOT sign any late add/drop forms.\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students – August 16th at 8:00am to September 6th at 4:00pm.

International finance is different in two basic respects: (1) the existence of multiple currencies adds risk to investment and financing decisions; (2) when corporations and portfolio investors cross international borders, both problems and opportunities arise. This course focuses on these issues and highlights how finance theory can be extended to address them. Students apply the basic principles of international finance to a variety of problems. The course helps students understand the ideas and research results of international finance and adapt what they learn to the practical problems in the increasingly globalized business world. The first part of the course outlines exchange rate volatility, barriers to international capital flows, and the value of international diversification. The second part presents a variety of problems, examples, and applications from the three basic themes described in part one. Spreadsheet assignments and a term project requiring data analysis develop research skills and illustrate academic concepts. Exams consist of computational, short answer, and short essay questions.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Graduate students only.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: NCC 5060 or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":350245,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5550","titleShort":"Fixed Inc &Int Rate Der","titleLong":"Fixed Income Securities and Interest Rate Options","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13235,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"raj15","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Jarrow"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B09","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB09","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***Johnson and Graduate Students Only ***\nLetter or S/U.

The projects are done by teams of students, typically four to five, supported by both the faculty and an experienced adviser. Lecture material covers the approach to structuring complex problems, conducting analytical work and developing conclusions and recommendations. Student teams are expected to communicate regularly with their clients and to have at least one interim and final presentations. These experiential-learning projects will integrate the concepts and knowledge covered in the core courses and immersions as well as other fall electives. These client-critical projects typically incorporate the broad areas of strategy, operations, finance or marketing.

What special challenges face women as they transition from students to managers to leaders? What do the latest research findings offer to women who are seeking C-level positions and the organizations that want to benefit from more women leaders? In this course, we will take a multi-pronged approach to learning about women and leadership to better prepare students of both genders to lead in organizations that are now comprised of nearly 50% women. To do this we will analyze case studies of women leaders pulled from a range of industries. We will review the current state of empirical evidence about the status of women as leaders, investigate the barriers that have made it more difficult for women to reach the top of the business world, and consider ways in which individuals and organizations can overcome them. Guest speakers will share their experiences with the class. Finally, there will be time to engage in deep reflection about what students expect from their careers, as well as a chance to consider the pathways they must take to become effective and inclusive leaders in increasingly diverse organizations.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":359203,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6150","titleShort":"Bus Chin in Cultural Context I","titleLong":"Business Chinese in Cultural Context I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16275,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"zc46","firstName":"Zhihong","middleName":"","lastName":"Chen"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"McGraw Hall 365","bldgDescr":"McGraw Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MCG365","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Prerequisite: two years (on heritage track) or three years of Chinese or equivalent.

We expect that students will take this opportunity to \"make it real\" - eLab is not about starting theoretical companies, or theoretically exploring potential business ideas. Rather, it is about starting real companies that have the potential to grow and provide employment and economic benefit to their founders, and to provide deep experiential learning in starting and growing a business.

The course focuses on three themes: (1) the source, discovery, and evaluation of technological opportunities on a university campus; (2) increasing the efficiency of the innovation process to produce new technologies that satisfy customer needs; and (3) the different mechanisms available to appropriate returns from technology. The course uses readings, cases, and discussions with practitioners to examine this phenomenon. After completing this class, students will be familiar with basic principles related to technology entrepreneurship and will have gained a deeper understanding of the technology commercialization process at Cornell.

However, most students find that the course applies equally well to their personal decisions. There are two other objectives. The first is to convey an enduring understanding of decision concepts, skills, and tools that, taken as a whole, comprise a troubleshooter's guide to dealing with the uncertainty, complexity, and conflict of the professional world. The second is to provide a framework for a good decision process in which all of the decision concepts, skills, and tools fit coherently. The pedagogical approach uses lectures, in-class exercises, and applications.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":367409,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6640","titleShort":"Changing the Game","titleLong":"Changing the Game: Purpose and Profit","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15621,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:00AM","timeEnd":"01:00PM","startDt":"10/28/2016","endDt":"10/29/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"fpk3","firstName":"Fred","middleName":"P.","lastName":"Keller"}],"pattern":"FS","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B05","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB05","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"10:00AM","timeEnd":"01:00PM","startDt":"11/11/2016","endDt":"11/12/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"FS","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B05","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB05","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"**Johnson and Grad Students Only**\r\n*Attendance at all sessions required*\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students August 16th thru September 6th with an additional Add/Drop period beginning October 12th at 8:00am to October 18th at 4:00pm. \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  October 15th at 8:00am to October 18th 4:00pm.

Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more interdependent parties. The purpose of this course is to understand the theory and processes of negotiation as it is practiced in a variety of settings. It is designed to complement the technical and diagnostic skills learned in other courses. A basic premise is that while a manager needs analytical skills to develop optimal solutions to problems, he or she also needs a broad array of negotiation skills for these solutions to be accepted and implemented. The course highlights the components of an effective negotiation and teaches students to analyze their own behavior in negotiations. It is largely experiential, giving students an opportunity to develop their skills by participating in negotiations and integrating their experiences with the principles presented in the assigned readings and course discussions.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":368109,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6682","titleShort":"Crisis Comm. for Business Ldrs","titleLong":"Crisis Communications for Business Leaders","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16500,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"tk626","firstName":"Theomary","middleName":"","lastName":"Karamanis"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B10","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB10","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"*MUST ATTEND FIRST CLASS*\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students August 16th thru September 6th with an additional Add/Drop period beginning October 12th at 8:00am to October 18th at 4:00pm. \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  October 15th at 8:00am to October 18th 4:00pm.

In general, an organization cannot survive without the trust of numerous stakeholders, and ethical lapses destroy trust and threaten vital stakeholder relationships. In today's volatile and fiercely competitive business environment, a manager must be able to identify and effectively resolve ethical issues that inevitably arise in the pursuit of business (and career) objectives. This course is designed to enhance students' skills in moral reasoning as it applies to managerial decision making. It begins by examining normative concepts and principles that typically enter into moral reasoning, then uses those concepts and principles to analyze cases. Discussions are designed to help students understand the moral issues confronting the decision makers in the cases and explore how those issues might be addressed in ethically responsible ways.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":350704,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6730","titleShort":"Derivatives Securities Part I","titleLong":"Derivatives Securities Part I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15448,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"10/07/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":13,"netid":"dh634","firstName":"Darien","middleName":"","lastName":"Huang"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"05:40PM","startDt":"09/26/2016","endDt":"09/26/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":13,"netid":"dh634","firstName":"Darien","middleName":"","lastName":"Huang"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***GM, GR and UG Srs Only***\n** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\nDeadline to Change Grading Option:  September 20th 4:00pm\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students – August 16th at 8:00am to September 6th at 4:00pm.
