and public sphere. Beginning with an interrogation of the relationship between the law and ethics, we will then explore the history of disability policy and law, and in doing so, closely examine the implications of a number of Supreme Court decisions. We will conclude by evaluating global perspectives on the contemporary state as well as future of disability rights, particularly as they intersect with bioethical debates. As a writing-intensive seminar, this course will allow for the development of critical thought and reasoning in both oral and written communication.\n\nFulfills the ILR Advanced Writing Requirement.

manufacturing and fabrication, low- and semi-skilled service work, i.e., restaurant servers and bus drivers, and even on expert and professional work like that to which most of you presumably aspire.  Among the central themes is the notion that technology does not unilaterally act upon workers, their employers, or society-at-large.  Rather, workers, managers, customers, institutions, and policymakers shape which advances take hold and which do not, the ways that these technologies are deployed in the workplace, and the ways that society can actively mitigate the costs to technological

Working with union contracts, constitutions, and by-laws from a diversity of national and local public- and private-sector agreements, the course examines how U.S. unions represent their members in different industries and different collective bargaining environments. Issues addressed include union representative/steward rights and responsibilities, contract enforcement structures and practice, access to information, new work systems, hours of work and scheduling, contingent staffing arrangements, workplace discrimination, health and safety, promotional opportunities, downsizing, leadership development, membership involvement and commitment, internal organizing, community coalition building, and decertification campaigns. Students practice hands-on work in interpreting contract language and preparing and presenting grievances and unfair labor practices.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: ILRLR 5000, ILRLR 5010.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":364616,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"6045","titleShort":"Special Topics in Labor Law","titleLong":"Special Topics in Labor Law","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16735,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"03/16/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"lha1","firstName":"Lee","middleName":"Howard","lastName":"Adler"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This new course will document how political forces expressed mostly as court decisions have re-shaped the unionized public sector workplace in the last decade.

Examples of precarious employment include the work of day laborers, domestic workers, guest workers and low-wage immigrant workers. Long-term and structural changes in the economy and society have driven this trend. Such changes have included the shift from a manufacturing based- to a service based-economy, implementation of labor-saving business strategies and technologies, the reduction of unionization rates and globalization-triggered immigration. The growth of precarious employment raises broad reaching research and policy questions about the future of work globally. This course will address these questions as well as proposed solutions. Along with studying scholarship on these issues, students will engage in semester-long research projects related to precarious workers in conjunction with the Worker Institute at Cornell."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Seminar on Precarious Workers"}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"3035","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"002","classNbr":14347,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"03/16/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lha1","firstName":"Lee","middleName":"Howard","lastName":"Adler"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"While the Brown decision seemed to end de jure segregation in America, a series of court cases and continuing housing, lending and other nationwide policies interfered with our Nation’s ability to end de facto segregation.
