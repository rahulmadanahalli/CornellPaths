Drawing from TV, film, fiction and theatre, this course explores the ways in which the female detective radically revises the conventions of the crime narrative in which she functions. Interrogating an inherent tension between gender and genre, we'll ask how different media construct female detectives and what gets re-visioned when Miss Marple and Clarice Starling fight violence and restore social order. By engaging with course texts, students will develop strategies for attentive reading and thoughtful writing. Assignments ranging from reviews to research papers will focus on critical thinking, preparation, clear prose, and papers structured around well-supported claims.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368231,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"1130","titleShort":"FWS: Going Undercover","titleLong":"FWS: Going Undercover: Radical Undercover Journalism and the (re)creation of Self","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17479,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rtp38","firstName":"Rosalie","middleName":"Tamar","lastName":"Purvis"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Judith Eisner Pavillion 201","bldgDescr":"Judith Eisner Pavillion","facilityDescrshort":"ESN201","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-Year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"FWS Session"}],"description":"What would it be like to go through life as a completely different person?

By examining works of John Howard Griffin, Sarah Jones, Morgan Spurlock, Barbara Ehrenreich, Norah Vincent and a variety of identity-probing texts, we examine the complex facets of diverse identities.

We will explore issues related to the figure of the gangster, the gender and class assumptions that underpin it, and the portrayal-almost always stereotypical-of Italian-American immigrant experience that emerges from our viewings. The aim will be to enhance our understanding of the role of mafia plays in American and Italian culture in the 20th and 21st centuries.

Taking its cue from the \"digital turn,\" this course rephrases a traditional question asked in film theory about the nature of the medium (What is film?) in terms of a historical question: What was film when it was still something to be cut, wound up, and carried around, a thing with a literally explosive potential? Reframing the object of study in this manner will help situate familiar narrative cinema within more unfamiliar scientific, aesthetic, and experimental contexts. Early film theorists saw great potential in the new medium, thought to be capable of conveying a new experience of movement and time, creating a new art of light and shadow, or functioning as a new kind of scientific instrument. Screenings will put readings of early film theory in dialogue with early European silent films that address similar concerns about the nature of cinema, such as A Trip to the Moon (1902), The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926), and Man with a Movie Camera (1929).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Taught in English.¬†Film¬†screening¬†one evening¬†night¬†per¬†week¬†TBA.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":354572,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"4585","titleShort":"Advanced Film&Video Projects","titleLong":"Advanced Film and Video Projects","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"STU","ssrComponentLong":"Studio","section":"501","classNbr":9930,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"dr557","firstName":"Dehanza","middleName":"","lastName":"Rogers"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts SB23","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZSB23","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["STU"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4793","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Intensive filmmaking/media production course in which students focus on developing and producing an accomplished creative project over the semester (16mm, HD, sound art, and multi-media are all options).

Considering questions of performance, censorship, embodiment, pleasure, and representational politics, we will evaluate how race, particularly Black skin, has been used as a signifier and complex code for various things on screen. In doing so, we will investigate how blackness is contingent on the specifics of its historical, social, and cultural production and, yet, open to multiple and competing claims. Therefore, blackness here is less a stable racial category than theoretical motor, operated by moving and contested discourses, histories, images, meanings, and performances by Black subjects. Focusing on Black skin representation and discourses of blackness as a cultural signifier, students will watch and discuss important representations and misrepresentations of blackness on screen.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.
