A fourth credit is available for additional mapping and indexing of historically significant Latin American landscapes. This documentation, requiring weekly meetings with the instructor, will create a spatial and analytical instrument for ongoing landscape and urban studies. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: junior, senior, or graduate standing.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Access key historical models, practices and precedents of Latin American landscape-making and urbanism.","Undertake comparative transnational research framework that is specific to the Latin American condition, allowing for comparative analysis and synthesis across national and regional borders in the Americas.","Document Latin America landscape-making and urbanism as it relates to the contemporary United States landscape projects.","Evaluate Euro-centric theories, methods, and paradigms that have been historically used to construe and construct landscape in Latin America."],"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AG","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":354130,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LA","catalogNbr":"6160","titleShort":"Site Engineering","titleLong":"Site Engineering","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1164,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:05AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"vea3","firstName":"Valerie","middleName":"","lastName":"Aymer"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Kennedy Hall 466","bldgDescr":"Kennedy Hall","facilityDescrshort":"KND466","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"201","classNbr":1165,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"vea3","firstName":"Valerie","middleName":"","lastName":"Aymer"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Kennedy Hall 466","bldgDescr":"Kennedy Hall","facilityDescrshort":"KND466","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":5,"unitsMaximum":5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC","DIS"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"LA","catalogNbr":"3160","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course exposes students to the fundamentals of site grading and its relationship to best environmental practices.

methods of landscape research by \"exposing\" them to one of the most fragile, dynamic and desired landscapes at today's world: the coast.  Moreover, understanding the coast as a landscape of desire and conflict will help students to critically engage with what we think as an \"objective research methodology\".  The course will engage with concrete sites, preferably at the coast of the United

provide Landscape Architecture Students (as well as Architecture, Planning students) with knowledge of the most relevant histories, theories and critical discourses related to the field from the scope of Landscape Design.  We tend to think that theories provide the insight to embitter practice.  However, there has been practice that provoked and enhanced disciplinary debate and actually generated a \"paradigm shift\".  The course launches a research question: it is only through the examination of influential design works that we can build the multiple dialogues between theory and practice: explore how theory is embedded into disciplinary production and study how pioneer works create specific and innovative disciplinary literature.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment

methods of landscape research by \"exposing\" them to one of the most fragile, dynamic and desired landscapes at today's world: the coast.  Moreover, understanding the coast as a landscape of desire and conflict will help students to critically engage with what we think as an \"objective research methodology\".  The course will engage with concrete sites, preferably at the coast of the United
