The course will emphasize entrepreneurship as a manageable process that can be applied in virtually any organizational setting. Further, it is a course that mixes theory with practice, and you will be challenged to apply principles, concepts and frameworks to real world situations. Opportunity recognition is the very basis from which entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial activity begins.
