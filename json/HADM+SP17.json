Topics include information and information management in organizations; fundamentals of relational database design and implementation; writing and running SQL queries; working in database design teams and as individual research analysts; database design and management using Microsoft Access; database normalization; data-driven decision making; conversion of data into information and knowledge that can be leveraged to achieve business objectives; the role of data and information management in contemporary society; and data management opportunities in the hospitality industry.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Elective.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"HA"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":367947,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"HADM","catalogNbr":"4055","titleShort":"Hosp, Health & Design Industry","titleLong":"Hospitality, Health and Design Industry Immersion Seminar","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":13643,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:05AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"rbh25","firstName":"Brooke","middleName":"","lastName":"Hollis"},{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"mms449","firstName":"Mardelle","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Shepley"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rv54","firstName":"Rohit","middleName":"","lastName":"Verma"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Statler Hall 398","bldgDescr":"Statler Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STL398","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Limited to juniors and seniors.

Students will work with BMFiddle as a tool to model a business idea in the cloud for collaborative feedback, eventually using it as the base for the creation of a strategic technology plan that integrates many types of cloud-based technology vendors (Google Apps, Grasshopper, Smartsheet, Salesforce, etc…) to maximize the execution and growth of a start-up entity or add value to an existing venture at the lowest possible cost. The objectives of the course are achieved through entrepreneurial pitching activities, hospitality case studies, alumni interview case development, reflective assignments, and a strategic technology business planning project.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Winter, spring, summer.","catalogComments":"Elective.

Further, it is a course that mixes theory with practice, and you will be challenged to apply principles, concepts and frameworks to real world situations.
