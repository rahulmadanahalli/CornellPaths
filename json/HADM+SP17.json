Topics include information and information management in organizations; fundamentals of relational database design and implementation; writing and running SQL queries; working in database design teams and as individual research analysts; database design and management using Microsoft Access; database normalization; data-driven decision making; conversion of data into information and knowledge that can be leveraged to achieve business objectives; the role of data and information management in contemporary society; and data management opportunities in the hospitality industry.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Elective.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"HA"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":367947,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"HADM","catalogNbr":"4055","titleShort":"Hosp, Health & Design Industry","titleLong":"Hospitality, Health and Design Industry Immersion Seminar","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":13643,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:05AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"rbh25","firstName":"Brooke","middleName":"","lastName":"Hollis"},{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"mms449","firstName":"Mardelle","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Shepley"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rv54","firstName":"Rohit","middleName":"","lastName":"Verma"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Statler Hall 398","bldgDescr":"Statler Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STL398","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Limited to juniors and seniors.
