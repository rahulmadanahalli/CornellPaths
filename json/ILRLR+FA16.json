We begin by reviewing the conditions of post-industrial labor in an era of declining unionization and weak federal and state protections. Next we review theories of legal consciousness and legal mobilization, which help explain the conditions under which low-wage workers learn about their rights and come forward to demand justice.  We walk through claimsmaking in an array of federal and state administrative bureaucracies, including wage and hour, health and safety, and discrimination.  We also look at how the immigration enforcement regime intersects with the tenets of at-will employment to grant employers wide latitude in retaliating against undocumented workers and stifling attempts at legal mobilization.  We next assess how these formal protections are filtered through various institutional gatekeepers (including legal advocates and medical experts) and how organizational compliance structures (such as human resources and mediation programs) have limited worker¿s ability to make claims on their rights.  We consider how intersecting bases of inequality (such as gender, race, and national origin) are processed by administrative bureaucracies, and how lay versus legal conceptions of workplace justice often diverge.  We end by considering the fallout of workplace abuse on individuals and their families.\t\r\n\r\nThis course fulfills the ILR Advanced Writing requirement.

Accordingly, it is co-taught with psychologist Steve Ceci, and is organized around highly controversial \"must-read\" books on diverse topics that expose students to fundamental puzzles about human behavior and social interaction. The readings, combined with guest lectures by the authors, introduce students to disciplinary similarities and differences in the perspectives, theories, concepts, assumptions, and methods used by sociologists (who focus on what happens between individuals) and psychologists (who focus on what happens within). The authors vary from year to year but include Malcolm Gladwell, Michelle Alexander, Nate Silver, and Nicholas Christakis. All authors have agreed to participate in a \"Q&amp;A\" session with the students. The course meets Cornell's SBA distribution requirement.\n \n ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"A University Course - This class highlights cross-disciplinary dialogue and debate.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":367291,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"3055","titleShort":"Rhetoric of the Labor Movement","titleLong":"Rhetoric of the Labor Movement","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15265,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"10:00PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"smn33","firstName":"Samuel","middleName":"Mayer","lastName":"Nelson"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 108","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS108","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPI","gradingBasisShort":"Opt NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course equips students to use different modes of rhetorical analysis to examine historical and contemporary artifacts in critical ways.  Grading is based on class participation, tests and a final paper.  The final paper requires students to identify primary source materials with a connection to either past or present labor movements and apply one or more of these modes of rhetorical criticism as the basis of an unique investigation into a particular labor movement's significant symbolic acts.  Students will be expected to hone their own teaching and public speaking skills by giving at least one major in class presentation.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":367292,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"3057","titleShort":"Environ Mediat&Negotiation","titleLong":"Environmental Mediation and Negotiation","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15513,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"10:00PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"10/07/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jgb53","firstName":"John","middleName":"G.","lastName":"Bickerman"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 217","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS217","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"10/07/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"6057","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"7W1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"10/07/2016","sessionLong":"Seven Week - First"}],"description":"This course is designed to explore environmental conflict resolution.  The course will build on existing student knowledge of theories of dispute resolution and explore application of these concepts to the field of environmental and natural resource conflicts.  The course will begin with a review of fundamental concepts of interest-based negotiation, mediation and other general dispute resolution techniques applicable to complex, multi-party environmental conflicts.  Students will then be introduced to the architecture of several environmental statutes and the manner in which these obligations are enforced by the federal and state governments and private parties.  An investigation of several natural resource conflicts will conclude the class. The goal of the class will be to expose students to the breadth of disputes to which alternative dispute resolution is now being used in environmental conflicts and to be able to compare and contrast the styles of mediation used in these matters.  Students will learn how these principles are applied in real environmental situations.  A key objective of the course is to enable students to both understand and think critically about the strengths and weaknesses of using alternative dispute resolution procedures to manage environmental conflicts.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall (weeks

In addition to focusing on how arbitrators manage hearings, the course will also cover the institutional and administrative arrangements that support the use of labor arbitration. How arbitrators are admitted to rosters and receive appointments from such \"providers\" as the American Arbitration Association, the Federal Mediation &amp; Conciliation Service, the New York State Public Employment Relations Board, the Cornell's ADR Services, etc.) will be examined. The rules used by Cornell and other providers will also be discussed.  The first day will conclude with a labor arbitration exercise and faculty debriefing.\nDuring the next segments of the course, students will examine contemporary practice issues such as discovery, subpoenas, pre-hearing briefs, and problems involving availability of witnesses. Detailed coverage of the standards of contract interpretation, discipline and the role of evidence will be provided. Throughout the course, role-plays and other assignments will test students' understanding of the critical role of the arbitrator in deciding labor disputes.
