These theories, which are covered in the first two segments of the course, provide some insight into where society is going and what challenges have emerged along the way.  In the third segment of the course, we will look more closely at the role of individuals and everyday interaction in the genesis of social phenomena.  We will explore theories about what motivates individuals' social behavior, the role of rationality and emotion, how the micromechanics of interpersonal contact can shape larger society, and the subtle links between biological and social processes.  In the final segment of the course, we will explore complex webs that emerge through social actors' connections to each other, and how these network structures have been shaped by the various processes that were examined during the semester.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"Forbidden Overlap: Students may not receive credit for both SOC 1101 and DSOC 1101.","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2594,"crseId":351429,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"3310","titleShort":"Modern European Politics","titleLong":"Modern European Politics","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1328,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:00AM","timeEnd":"06:00PM","startDt":"05/31/2015","endDt":"06/20/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"crw12","firstName":"Christopher","middleName":"Robert","lastName":"Way"}],"pattern":"MTWRFSu","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Offered in Turin.
