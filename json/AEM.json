What choices and challenges do they face—how do they balance priorities and pursue opportunities in order to maximize the health and happiness of their families? This seminar explores smallholder food systems and household welfare in sub-Saharan Africa, employing an interactive farmer-simulation game, diverse readings, and writing assignments from a farmer's perspective. Throughout the semester, each student will seek to maximize the welfare of a given farming family by making planting and investment decisions, allocating family labor, and dealing with crises of weather or health. Writing assignments will include some research, and will often take the form of farmer reports to the United Nations, assessing the effectiveness of \"development\" policy recommendations.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":350468,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"AEM","catalogNbr":"1230","titleShort":"Foundations of Entrep & Bus","titleLong":"Foundations of Entrepreneurship and Business","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":3794,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"03:20PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"pdp5","firstName":"Pedro","middleName":"D.","lastName":"Perez"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Warren Hall B25","bldgDescr":"Warren Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WRNB25","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Preference given to: AEM Majors."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Introductory course providing a sound base to both the understanding of entrepreneurial activity and possibilities and the study and practice of entrepreneurship at Cornell.

When if, and how can firms make money by going green? Can firms save money by reducing pollution? Will consumers pay for green? What business strategies have resulted in success and what strategies in failure? For example, has consumer suspicion of \"green-washing\" backfired on companies selling green?

Do you want to learn how to write a long research paper? Do you not want to take a final examination? If so this course may be for you. Since the beginning of the republic, American intellectuals, politicians and businessmen have extolled the exceptionalism of America. In a world of diverse forms of capitalism, can this view be sustained? Is America a shining city on the hill or a darkened city in the valley? Comparison is an effective way to discern and assess what is unique and what is general in the distinctive form of America's capitalist democracy. In this course the liberal market economy of the United States with its distinctive strengths and weaknesses is put side-by-side with different forms of liberal, corporatist and statist market economies that characterize different European countries in the emerging European polity. The diversity of capitalism points to one overarching conclusion: all of these countries are arguably capitalist, democratic market economies belonging to \"the West;\" and each of them has distinctive strengths and weaknesses. Like all other countries, America is ordinary in mobilizing its formidable capacities and displaying its glaring weaknesses as it copes with change. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":368238,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"AEM","catalogNbr":"3600","titleShort":"Impact Learning Fld Stdy Prep","titleLong":"Impact Learning: Field Study Prep Experience","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17549,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"djp7","firstName":"Debra","middleName":"Wood","lastName":"Perosio"},{"instrAssignSeq":6,"netid":"ct30","firstName":"Cate","middleName":"","lastName":"Thompson"},{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"clv1","firstName":"Cindy","middleName":"Lynn","lastName":"Van Es"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Warren Hall 137","bldgDescr":"Warren Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WRN137","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Application process for enrollment is now closed."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"BMT","gradingBasisShort":"Multi-Term","gradingBasisLong":"Multi-Term Course: Not Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"10/10/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"}],"description":"The lectures/discussions will introduce you to the influence of race, gender, and culture on corporations, small businesses and entrepreneurial enterprises in South Africa.

Main areas will include the effects of financial globalization on growth, volatility, and the transmission of business cycles. The course will also examine the determinants of the direction and composition of capital flows.

Do you want to learn how to write a long research paper? Do you not want to take a final examination? If you answer these questions affirmatively, this course may be for you. We are told often that American primacy is in decline and that other powers are rising. What does this mean when we examine the experience of Government and Business in different countries around the world?  Is the international political economy a hydraulic system in which some units rise and others fall? Are the dynamics of the international political economy all pointing in one direction? Or are they marked by cross-currents?  This course seeks answers to these questions by teaching the basics of macro-economics, examining a range of powerful states (among others China, India, Russia and Japan) and persisting issues (financial globalization and foreign investment; oil and OPEC; trade and aid) as they play themselves out in different countries (such as Malaysia, Korea; Saudi Arabia, Nigeria; Mexico, Brazil, Uganda, Indonesia).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"BU","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":359932,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"AEM","catalogNbr":"4020","titleShort":"Food & Brand Lab Wrkshp I","titleLong":"Food and Brand Lab Workshop I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":2456,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:30PM","timeEnd":"07:00PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"bcw28","firstName":"Brian","middleName":"C.","lastName":"Wansink"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Preference given to AEM Majors.
