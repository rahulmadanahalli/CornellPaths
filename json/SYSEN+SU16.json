Single-solution based, population based, as well as hybrid techniques are examined. A survey of classical exact optimization methods is given to put metaheuristics in context, and the problem characteristics that favor a heuristic approach are discussed. This course uses implementation case studies to emphasize the solution process representation, computation, parameter estimation, and performance analysis. Students will complete a demonstration project by implementing a metaheuristic solution on a problem of their choice.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisites: Student should have working knowledge of a high-level programming language (e.g., Matlab, Python, C, Java).
