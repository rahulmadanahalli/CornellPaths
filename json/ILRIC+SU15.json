This course will provide students an introduction to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and a more in-depth comparative policy analysis of current and emerging disability and employment policy in specific parts of the world (e.g., the United States, South East Asia, Russia, South America, New Zealand, India, South Africa and Europe). Students will identify and discuss current events shaping international disability policy; conduct personal interviews of key informants to obtain firsthand knowledge of the experience of disability; and, participate in team-based classroom debates.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, winter, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL"}]
