The course includes two parts. In the first part, students develop a set of core skills essential to equity research and financial statement analysis. We cover information sources, strategic ratio analysis, cash flow analysis, forecasting financial statements, and firm valuation using discounted cash flow and residual income techniques. The second part focuses on more advanced financial statement topics and specialized industries. We cover investment research, accounting analysis, credit analysis, banking, mergers and acquisitions, and issues relating to international financial statement analysis. The course emphasizes the practical application of the material using a combination of lecture, cases, and hands-on examples.  Students are evaluated based on an equity research project and two exams.  The course presumes an understanding of basic corporate finance theory and basic financial accounting, but little or no previous experience in security valuation.

Topics considered here include swaps, credit derivatives, value at risk models, and systemic risk.

International finance is different in two basic respects: (1) the existence of multiple currencies adds risk to investment and financing decisions; (2) when corporations and portfolio investors cross international borders, both problems and opportunities arise. This course focuses on these issues and highlights how finance theory can be extended to address them. Students apply the basic principles of international finance to a variety of problems. The course helps students understand the ideas and research results of international finance and adapt what they learn to the practical problems in the increasingly globalized business world. The first part of the course outlines exchange rate volatility, barriers to international capital flows, and the value of international diversification. The second part presents a variety of problems, examples, and applications from the three basic themes described in part one. Spreadsheet assignments and a term project requiring data analysis develop research skills and illustrate academic concepts. Exams consist of computational, short answer, and short essay questions.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Graduate students only.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: NCC 5060 or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":350245,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5550","titleShort":"Fixed Inc &Int Rate Der","titleLong":"Fixed Income Securities and Interest Rate Options","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15700,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"08/27/2018","endDt":"12/06/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"raj15","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Jarrow"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***Johnson and Graduate Students Only ***\nLetter or S/U.

This course is designed for AMBA and two year residential students who want to apply the knowledge they are gaining to real business problems. Over the spring and summer largely fortune 500 companies are solicited for projects that students can work on during the fall semester with two to four days during the semester of on-site interaction with the companies at their location or on campus. The projects are done by teams of students, typically five, supported by both the faculty and an adviser. You should expect to spend on average 6-8 hours per week on the course including class time.  Lecture material covers the approach to structuring complex problems, conducting analytical work and developing conclusions and recommendations. Student teams are expected to communicate regularly with their clients and to have at a minimum an interim and final presentation. The projects will build on concepts and knowledge built in the core courses and immersions as well as other fall electives.

This course is designed for students who may someday work in, consult for, and/or create firms whose primary product is fundamentally related to technology or innovation. The course typically includes both M.B.A. students and graduate students in science. It starts by examining how industries are transformed by new technologies and how these patterns of industrial change generate both opportunity and high rates of firm failure. We will then explore the questions: Why do some technology leaders fail? and How do technology innovators successfully take on and replace incumbent firms? This leads to an examination of internal management issues, focusing on the design of innovative organizations: designing reward systems, managing growth, overcoming resistance to change, and using organizational culture to promote innovation.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":368109,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6682","titleShort":"Crisis Comm. for Business Ldrs","titleLong":"Crisis Communications for Business Leaders","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15035,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/27/2018","endDt":"10/16/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"tk626","firstName":"Theomary","middleName":"","lastName":"Karamanis"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"* Must Attend First Class*\n******MAXIMUM TWO ABSENCES ALLOWED******  \nOpen to Johnson and Grad Students Only\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students – August 14th at 8:00am thru September 6th at 4:00pm.

In general, an organization cannot survive without the trust of numerous stakeholders, and ethical lapses destroy trust and threaten vital stakeholder relationships. In today's volatile and fiercely competitive business environment, a manager must be able to identify and effectively resolve ethical issues that inevitably arise in the pursuit of business (and career) objectives. This course is designed to enhance students' skills in moral reasoning as it applies to managerial decision making. It begins by examining normative concepts and principles that typically enter into moral reasoning, then uses those concepts and principles to analyze cases. Discussions are designed to help students understand the moral issues confronting the decision makers in the cases and explore how those issues might be addressed in ethically responsible ways.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":350704,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6730","titleShort":"Derivatives Securities Part I","titleLong":"Derivatives Securities Part I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":14833,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"08/27/2018","endDt":"10/16/2018","instructors":[],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***GM, GR and UG Srs/Jrs Only***\n** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\nDeadline to Change Grading Option: September 20th.\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students – August 14th at 8:00am thru September 6th at 4:00pm.
