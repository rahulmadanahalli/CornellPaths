Topics include the cellular and molecular basis for cell signaling, the functions of neurons in communication and in decision making; neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, sensory systems, motor systems, neural development, learning and memory, and other complex brain functions. The course will emphasize how the nervous system is built during development, how it changes with experiences during life, how it functions in normal behavior, and how it is disrupted by injury and disease. Discussion sections will include a dissection of a preserved sheep brain.

This course examines the neural origins of motor behavior, from simple reflexes to complex learned motor sequences. Ascending the motor hierarchy, we will study the neuromuscular junction, spinal cord, brainstem, cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. At each level, we will examine the structure and function of the local microcircuit, as well as diseases-such as myasthenia gravis, stroke, ALS, ataxia and Parkinson's-that result from that circuit's dysfunction.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: BIONB 2220 or ECE 2100 or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 25 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["To understand the structure and function of the vertebrate motor system, including neural mechanisms of human movement disorders.","To critically read and comprehend primary literature.","To distill large amounts of information into central concepts of nervous system function, and to articulate these concepts both verbally and in writing.","To creatively come up with new ideas and design experiments to test them."],"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":358412,"crseOfferNbr":4,"subject":"BIONB","catalogNbr":"4330","titleShort":"Topics In Cognitive Science","titleLong":"Topics in Cognitive Science","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16321,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:00PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"se37","firstName":"Shimon","middleName":"","lastName":"Edelman"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 260","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH260","meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Consciousness & Free Will"}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"COGST","catalogNbr":"4310","type":"C"},{"subject":"LING","catalogNbr":"4310","type":"C"},{"subject":"PSYCH","catalogNbr":"4320","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"A course examining the core disciplines of cognitive science using varied themes from semester to semester.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: COGST 3140 or PSYCH 3140.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":361200,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"BIONB","catalogNbr":"4980","titleShort":"Teaching Experience","titleLong":"Teaching Experience","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"603","classNbr":4821,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rar229","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Raguso"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Undergraduate Teaching Experience in BIONB 2210 -

Description: Networks that drive behavior are formed from neurons with complex intrinsic electrophysiological properties, connected by synapses that are highly plastic and variable. This course will read literature and discuss how these networks drive flexible behavior, at a cellular level of analysis. Topics include: using combinations of ion channels to build neurons with different firing properties; principles of network connectivity; mechanisms shaping different components of the behavior (ex., intensity, phasing, rhythm); modulatory inputs and plasticity mechanisms driving variable output from an anatomically fixed network; and evolution of neural networks. Examples will include Central Pattern Generators for locomotion and respiration, as well as other systems in vertebrates and invertebrates of the students’ choice."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Fundamentals of Behavioral Network Function"}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2018","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Designed to provide several study groups each semester on specialized topics.
