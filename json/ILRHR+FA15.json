perspectives from management and economics, this course explores diverse factors such as individual characteristics and organizational practices that affect the levels and methods of pay (not only wages and salaries, but also such things as bonuses, contingent rewards, benefits, and working conditions).  The course also examines several recent pay related issues that have been in the news such as increasing the minimum wage and pay inequality.  By the completion of the course, students will  have a better understanding of what goes into the making of pay decisions and why it matters.  Since the course is designed as a broad overview of the topic (and not as a \"how-to\" of compensation administration) there is no prerequisite for

This suggests that much work remains to be done in organizations. The purpose of this course is to introduce current theory, research, and practice regarding discrimination and inclusion in the workplace.  We will adopt a largely psychological approach to understanding bias, stereotyping, and prejudice and how they manifest in organizations. We will also examine the role of HR and diversity practices as well as leadership behaviors in fostering inclusion. A guiding assumption for this course is that in order to fully understand the implications of diversity for organizations you must personally confront issues having to do with power, privilege, stereotypes, identity, and discrimination. Toward this end, we will adopt an experiential approach whenever possible. Writing assignments will include a mix of personal reflections and scholarly analysis.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: ILRHR
