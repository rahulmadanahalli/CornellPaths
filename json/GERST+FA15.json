 The answer lies in Romanticism and its appropriation of the imagination as a force for social transformation.  As Romantics edited older tales for juvenile consumption they wrote new ones for adults.  This new fiction created the matrix for modern pop genres like fantasy, science-fiction, murder mysteries, and gothic horror.  To understand this paradigm shift in modern culture, we will read, discuss, and write about a variety of texts the Romantics collected, composed, or inspired, including poetry and film, in addition to classic fairy tales and academic scholarship on the topic.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"No knowledge of German is expected.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367521,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"1112","titleShort":"FWS: Music and Letters","titleLong":"FWS: Music and Letters","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18265,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"km393","firstName":"Klas Erik","middleName":"","lastName":"Molde"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 144","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH144","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"FWS Session"}],"description":"Homer's epics make no mention of music, because to the earliest European poets it was an integral and therefore not distinct part of their performance. Although since then considered separate arts, music and letters have enjoyed an exceptionally close relationship in German culture. Modern literature attempts to make sense of music and uses music to approach the senseless. This course addresses 1) music as poetic device and 2) music as theme in German literature since 1800. Exploring these issues, we will work on developing arguments in critical writing. Readings may include Hölderlin, Hoffmann, Kleist, Nietzsche, Rilke, Mann, Bernhard, and Jelinek. We will also familiarize ourselves with the tradition of the art song (Lied) and watch at least one opera by Mozart and/or Wagner.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":355528,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"1170","titleShort":"FWS: Marx, Nietzsche, Freud","titleLong":"FWS: Marx, Nietzsche, Freud","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18266,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"pd363","firstName":"Paul","middleName":"","lastName":"Dobryden"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 348","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH348","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"FWS Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"102","classNbr":18267,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jg828","firstName":"Jette","middleName":"","lastName":"Gindner"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Balch Hall - Tatkon Ctr 3331","bldgDescr":"Balch Hall","facilityDescrshort":"BAL3331","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"FWS Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"104","classNbr":18269,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:00AM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"jd834","firstName":"Jonathan","middleName":"","lastName":"Davenport"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 181","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH181","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"FWS Session"}],"description":"A basic understanding of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud is a prerequisite for participating in critical debates in the humanities and social sciences.

We will start with fairy tales and texts from the Romantic Period, and then continue with exploring the changing perspective on nature triggered by the onset of industrialization during the 19th Century, including the \"back to nature\" movements that responded to industrialization, such as the Wandervogel movement, the Utopian community at Monte Verità, and the popularization of naturopathy. Next we will discuss nature symbolism in Nazi ideology, and then move on to the significant environmental changes during the second half of the 20th Century, more recently termed \"The Great Transformation.\" Here, topics will include the steep rise in environmental consciousness during the 70s and 80s, the success and tremendous political effect of Germany's Green Party, the nuclear catastrophes of Tschernobyl and Fukushima, and contemporary issues of food production and waste management.

disrupting her life, through analysis of dreams, symptoms, bungled actions, slips of the tongue, and repetitive behaviors.  Freud finds that these apparently irrational acts and behavior are ordered by the logic of the fantasy, which provides a mental representation of a taumatic childhood experience and the effects it unleashes in the mind and body-effects he called drives.  As \"unbound\" energies, the drives give rise to symptoms, repetitive acts, and fantasmatic stagings that menace our health and sometimes threaten social coexistence, but that also rise to the desires, creative acts, and social projects we identify as the essence of human life.  Readings will include fundamental texts on the unconscious, repression, fantasy, and the death drive, as well as case studies and speculative essays on mythology, art, religion, and group psychology.  Students will be asked to keep a dream journal and to work on their unconscious formations, and will have the chance to produce creative projects as well as analytic essays.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(KCM-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":364699,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"3620","titleShort":"Intro

Kafka, and Beckett). Established in 1920s at the Institute for Social Research, the assorted circle of scholars comprising the Frankfurt School played a pivotal role in the intellectual developments of post-war American and European political and aesthetic theory. Often known simply as \"Critical Theory,\" their key works cover a vast array of intellectual, political, economic, and artistic concerns, from the dialectic of enlightenment to commentaries on popular culture, high art, commodity fetishism, and mass society.

We consider basic aspects of their work: (a) specific critical and historical analyses; (b) theoretical and methodological writings; (c) programs and manifestos; and (d) styles of argumentation, documentation, and persuasion. This also entails an introduction, for non-specialists, to essential problems of political economy, continental philosophy, psychology, and literary and cultural criticism. Second, we compare the underlying assumptions and the interpretive yields of the various disciplines and practices founded by Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud: historical materialism and communism, existentialism and power-knowledge analysis, and psychoanalysis, respectively.

representations of the absolutist state in baroque opera, examining its preoccupation with paradigms of good and bad rulership before turning to attempts in operas such as Die Zauberflöte and Fidelio to imagine implications of the absolutist legacy for civil society and the emerging bureaucratic state.  Other sessions will be devoted to nineteenth-century opera, focusing on responses to the French Revolution and the changing role of the masses and \"the people\" (Grand opéra, Wagner), before turning to the years immediately before and during World War II, ranging from the Zeitoper of the 1920s

attention to his main sources, e.g., Croce, Dante, Lenin, Marx, Machiavelli); and then to trace main directions of the Gramscian legacy in philosophy, political theory and practice, and cultural theory and practice (notably filmmaking).  This legacy includes the works of Aijaz Ahmad, Louis Althusser, Christine Buci-Glucksmann, Norberto Bobbio, Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe, and Pier-Paolo
