Students engage in a \"Public Policy Challenge\" (modeled after business school competitions) that builds real-world skills as team members work together on a policy proposal and civic campaign to address a real problem in the community with an innovative solution. Working intensively with faculty, team members, and the local community, students will listen to and learn from local community members and literature about problems and needs, select and frame the policy challenge and design a solution, and develop community engagement, marketing, funding and evaluation plans for implementation.
