This course surveys the history of the West from remote antiquity to the 16th century. We will consider developments in technology, economy, politics, religious institutions and faiths, cultural media and social ideals. Together, these themes add up to civilization in the west. We will acquaint ourselves with these dimensions of the past while seeking to acquire the basic skills professional historians use to learn about this past.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, summer.","catalogComments":"Students will be required to attend a discussion session.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2594,"crseId":352560,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"1511","titleShort":"Making of Mod Europe 1500-Pres","titleLong":"The Making of Modern Europe, from 1500 to the Present","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1341,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"03:45PM","startDt":"06/22/2015","endDt":"07/31/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"trt5","firstName":"Thomas","middleName":"Robert","lastName":"Travers"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"Warren Hall 101","bldgDescr":"Warren Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WRN101","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

This course seeks to answer these questions by exploring the history of modern Europe. Among other themes, we will discuss the Protestant Reformation, the rise of absolutism, the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, industrialism, colonialism, the Russian Revolution, the two world wars, decolonization and immigration, May '68, and the construction of the European Union. In conjunction, we will examine how modern ideologies (liberalism, Marxism, imperialism, conservatism, fascism, totalitarianism) were developed and challenged. Through a wide array of historical documents (fiction, letters, philosophy, treatises, manifestos, films, and art), we will consider why \"old Europe\" is still relevant for us today.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Each student must enroll in a section.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2594,"crseId":367094,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"1571","titleShort":"American Military History","titleLong":"American Military History from the World Ward to 9/11, Iraq and Afghanistan, 1900-2014","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1342,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"11:45AM","startDt":"06/08/2015","endDt":"07/31/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"ds90","firstName":"David","middleName":"","lastName":"Silbey"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Wolpe Center 118","bldgDescr":"Wolpe Center","facilityDescrshort":"WLP118","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in Washington, DC.

They have been the longest wars in American history and have ended amid much ambivalence about the US engagement in each place and the results. They are part of a series of wars that America has fought as a global power, with a global reach, sending its forces thousands of miles from home. That global reach is not new, and goes back all the way to 1898 and the Spanish-American War. This course will look at the American military experience from our first tentative steps onto the global stage in 1898, to the earth-spanning conflicts of World War I and II, to the nuclear tension of Cold War conflicts, and finish with the current Long War against terrorism, and the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2594,"crseId":366280,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"1880","titleShort":"American Constitutional Histor","titleLong":"American Constitutional History","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1343,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:00AM","timeEnd":"11:15AM","startDt":"06/22/2015","endDt":"07/31/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"rp19","firstName":"Richard","middleName":"","lastName":"Polenberg"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"McGraw Hall 366","bldgDescr":"McGraw Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MCG366","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.
