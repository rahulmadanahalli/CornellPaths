The course will rely primarily on the case method to examine how student beliefs and decisions hold up to the scrutiny of critical thinking, analysis, and relevant research from across the social sciences. Students will be exposed to the best available research evidence so they leave the course with an appreciation for the science that can guide their approach to leading others. To facilitate development as a leader, Principled Leadership also requires students to personalize course concepts by engaging in a number of assessments, self-reflections, and exercises and to practice important leadership skills such as issue selling and responding to crises.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":366790,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NCCY","catalogNbr":"5080","titleShort":"Operations Management","titleLong":"Operations Management","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18145,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"09/24/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"vg77","firstName":"Vishal","middleName":"","lastName":"Gaur"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"NY Tech MBA Students Only.

Almost any business function can be modeled as a network of processes. The first part of the course examines processes, both individually and as part of a larger system; students see that good process design reflects both the volume and the variety of the product. A common course theme is the deleterious effect of variability (in demand, supply, quality, or capacity) in complex systems. Queuing theory and simulation are particularly helpful for analyzing process capabilities. The second part analyzes how goods and services are produced. After describing the strategic role of operations, it examines forecasting systems, inventory management, and just-in-time and logistic management. Constrained optimization models provide information about managing with finite resources. The final part examines process improvement through quality and productivity management and corporate learning.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM","roster":"FA15"}]
