of the imagination as a force for social transformation.  As Romantics edited older tales for juvenile consumption they wrote new ones for adults.  This new fiction created the matrix for modern pop genres like fantasy, science-fiction, murder mysteries, and gothic horror.  To understand this paradigm shift in modern culture, we will read, discuss, and write about a variety of texts the Romantics collected, composed, or inspired, including poetry and film, in addition to classic fairy tales and academic scholarship on the topic.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring.","catalogComments":"No knowledge of German is

contrast as well as convergence.  Discussions and writing exercises will focus on texts that created the discursive framework for critiquing society and culture today.  Our method will proceed from the premise that critical reading, thinking, and writing are inseparable moments in the same operation of critique.  The question that guides that method will be: Do alternative ways of thinking exist

Units address a variety of topics including studying at a German university, modern literature, Germany online, and Germany at the turn of the century. Oral and written work and individual and group presentations emphasize accurate and idiomatic expression in German. Successful completion of the course enables students to continue with more advanced courses in language, literature, and culture.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"Satisfies Option 1.","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"A content-based language course on the intermediate level.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: GERST 1230 or LPG 56-64 or SAT II 590-680, or placement by exam.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":351325,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"2040","titleShort":"Perspectives on German Culture","titleLong":"Perspectives on German Culture","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":6537,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"aem235","firstName":"Andreea","middleName":"Ecaterina","lastName":"Mascan"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"White Hall B14","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHTB14","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Prerequisite: GERST 2000, or placement by examination (placement score and CASE).

and revisited-in a different light.  The defeated revolutions of the past century put into question a teleological vision of history, engendering the decline of Marxist historiography and the simultaneous appearance of memory, a previously ignored concept for interpreting the past.  Outlining a symbolic shift from Marx to Benjamin, this change has a melancholic flavor that permeates many expressions of contemporary Left culture (from movies and autobiographies to historical and philosophical essays).  On the other hand, the emergence of Postcolonialism reopened the debate on the Eurocentric roots of Marx's thought and stimulated a new approach to some classical Marxist thinkers and historians such as Gramsci and C.L.R. James.  Taking into account both classical and contemporary texts, the seminar will analyze a reconfigured relationship between history and memory in the Left culture of our post-utopian age.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with COML 6416/FREN 6435/GERST 6431/GOVT

Its ideas, debates and controversies could be viewed-historicized and revisited-in a different light. The defeated revolutions of the past century put into question a teleological vision of history, engendering the decline of Marxist historiography and the simultaneous appearance of memory, a previously ignored concept for interpreting the past. Outlining a symbolic shift from Marx to Benjamin, this change has a melancholic flavor that permeates many expressions of contemporary Left culture (from movies and autobiographies to historical and philosophical essays). On the other hand, the emergence of Postcolonialism reopened the debate on the Eurocentric roots of Marx's thought and stimulated a new approach to some classical Marxist thinkers and historians such as Gramsci and C.L.R. James. Taking into account both classical and contemporary texts, the seminar will analyze a reconfigured relationship between history and memory in the Left culture of our post-utopian age.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with COML 4416/FREN 4435/GERST 4431/GOVT 4696/HIST 4234/ROMS 4430.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":357990,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"6510","titleShort":"Contemporary Aesthetic Theory","titleLong":"Contemporary Aesthetic Theory and its Discontents","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16214,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"pg33","firstName":"Peter","middleName":"","lastName":"Gilgen"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Olin Library 403","bldgDescr":"Olin Library","facilityDescrshort":"OLL403","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"6510","type":"C"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6370","type":"C"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"6500","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"After having been reduced to a mere ideological formation of bourgeois origin, aesthetics has recently made a strong comeback in the field of theory.

Students will be introduced to representative examples of contemporary German literatures of migration, and critical modes of conceptualizing cultural contact in Germany will be compared in relation to each other and in tension with the literary field.

contrast as well as convergence.  Discussions and writing exercises will focus on texts that created the discursive framework for critiquing society and culture today.  Our method will proceed from the premise that critical reading, thinking, and writing are inseparable moments in the same operation of critique.  The question that guides that method will be: Do alternative ways of thinking exist

Students will choose and investigate a research topic that will allow them to delve into questions and practices relating to cultural communication. Possible topics include migrant and minority cultures; privacy and data protection; environmental conservation and the challenge of climate change. Besides the one-week travel the course involves pre- and post-travel sessions on the Cornell campus. The first part of the course is devoted to analyzing different ways of defining culture, as well as related concepts of inter- and transculturality, based primarily but not exclusively on the work of cultural anthropologist Joana Breidenbach. In the second part we will apply these theoretical concepts to the chosen research topic as we explore local contexts during the travel to Germany. Our post-travel sessions will be devoted to interrogating the mechanism and reach of stereotypical categorization and cultural claims in addition to assessing the outcomes of the research we conducted on the collaborative project. The aim of the course is to foster awareness of cultural difference and local contexts, as well as the critical ability to describe and question the stereotypical assumptions that underpin cultural identity. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: GERST 2000 or above or equivalent.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 8 students (students in the Language House given preference).

actor in public spheres.  During those years, the Jewish intellectual becomes a privileged object of investigations, definitions and fantasies -- including anti-Semitic stereotypes -- for literature and popular culture, sociology and medicine or law, deeply shaping national mentalities and imagination.  A considerable iconography, from painting to political propaganda and illustrated magazines, sketches his real or invented profile.  As an incarnation of urbanity, mobility, extraterritoriality, textuality and rational thought, the Jewish intellectual turns out to be a mirror of modernity, eliciting a strong conservative rejection.  Lasting from the Dreyfus Affair to the Nazi burning of books in 1933, and focusing on three national contexts -- France, Germany and Italy -- the course tries to explore the history of this collective representation through its multiple expressions, both textual and visual.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with GERST 6231/HIST 6232/JWST 6230/ROMS

In spite of its highly controversial uses, the concept of \"European Civil War\" is probably the must useful in order to sum up such an \"age of  extremes\" in which wars have no rules: they become wars against civilians, politics makes groups into implacable enemies and an endemic violence deeply reshaped both cultures and collective imagination.

actor in public spheres.  During those years, the Jewish intellectual becomes a privileged object of investigations, definitions and fantasies -- including anti-Semitic stereotypes -- for literature and popular culture, sociology and medicine or law, deeply shaping national mentalities and imagination.  A considerable iconography, from painting to political propaganda and illustrated magazines, sketches his real or invented profile.  As an incarnation of urbanity, mobility, extraterritoriality, textuality and rational thought, the Jewish intellectual turns out to be a mirror of modernity, eliciting a strong conservative rejection.  Lasting from the Dreyfus Affair to the Nazi burning of books in 1933, and focusing on three national contexts -- France, Germany and Italy -- the course tries to explore the history of this collective representation through its multiple expressions, both textual and visual.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with GERST 4231/HIST 4232/JWST 4230/ROMS

Concentrating on novels ranging from the late 19th to the early 20th century, we will pay close attention to questions of narrative structure as well as temporal and spatial arrangements. Also including comparatist interests, the seminar will discuss the modern German novel within the European context; discuss generic differences (modern versus \"classic\"); examine theories of the novel and their relationship to contemporary representational concerns. Specific points of interest are: the status of self-reflection; philosophical interruptions; irony; montage; subjectivity and literary self-projection; literature and urbanity.  In order to evaluate the \"very\" modern, the class will also discuss two examples of contemporary fiction. Authors include: Rilke, Kafka, Döblin, Broch, Th. Mann, R.

Yet since World War II, his influence, his reputation, and his fascination for scholars in a wide range of cultural and political disciplines has steadily grown. He is seen as a bridging figure between German and Jewish studies, between materialist critique of culture and the submerged yet powerful voice of theology, between literary history and philosophy. We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":351387,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"7540","titleShort":"Independent

Philosophers and poets for a few thousand years have contemplated the close kinship between madness and genius and have engaged in lively discussions about changing definitions of creativity as either ingenuity, inspiration, or insanity; as stemming from divine possession, originality, or fanatic enthusiasm. By reading philosophical and medical treatises, by examining texts of fiction and lyric poetry, as well as by including historical accounts, this course will find out when and why our culture decided to call a madman a genius and a genius mad.

 The answer lies in Romanticism and its appropriation of the imagination as a force for social transformation.  As Romantics edited older tales for juvenile consumption they wrote new ones for adults.  This new fiction created the matrix for modern pop genres like fantasy, science-fiction, murder mysteries, and gothic horror.  To understand this paradigm shift in modern culture, we will read, discuss, and write about a variety of texts the Romantics collected, composed, or inspired, including poetry and film, in addition to classic fairy tales and academic scholarship on the topic.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"No knowledge of German is expected.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367521,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"1112","titleShort":"FWS: Music and Letters","titleLong":"FWS: Music and Letters","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18265,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"km393","firstName":"Klas Erik","middleName":"","lastName":"Molde"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 144","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH144","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"FWS Session"}],"description":"Homer's epics make no mention of music, because to the earliest European poets it was an integral and therefore not distinct part of their performance. Although since then considered separate arts, music and letters have enjoyed an exceptionally close relationship in German culture. Modern literature attempts to make sense of music and uses music to approach the senseless. This course addresses 1) music as poetic device and 2) music as theme in German literature since 1800. Exploring these issues, we will work on developing arguments in critical writing. Readings may include Hölderlin, Hoffmann, Kleist, Nietzsche, Rilke, Mann, Bernhard, and Jelinek. We will also familiarize ourselves with the tradition of the art song (Lied) and watch at least one opera by Mozart and/or Wagner.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":355528,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"1170","titleShort":"FWS: Marx, Nietzsche, Freud","titleLong":"FWS: Marx, Nietzsche, Freud","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18266,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"pd363","firstName":"Paul","middleName":"","lastName":"Dobryden"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 348","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH348","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"FWS Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"102","classNbr":18267,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jg828","firstName":"Jette","middleName":"","lastName":"Gindner"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Balch Hall - Tatkon Ctr 3331","bldgDescr":"Balch Hall","facilityDescrshort":"BAL3331","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"FWS Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"104","classNbr":18269,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:00AM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"jd834","firstName":"Jonathan","middleName":"","lastName":"Davenport"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 181","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH181","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"FWS Session"}],"description":"A basic understanding of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud is a prerequisite for participating in critical debates in the humanities and social sciences.

We will start with fairy tales and texts from the Romantic Period, and then continue with exploring the changing perspective on nature triggered by the onset of industrialization during the 19th Century, including the \"back to nature\" movements that responded to industrialization, such as the Wandervogel movement, the Utopian community at Monte Verità, and the popularization of naturopathy. Next we will discuss nature symbolism in Nazi ideology, and then move on to the significant environmental changes during the second half of the 20th Century, more recently termed \"The Great Transformation.\" Here, topics will include the steep rise in environmental consciousness during the 70s and 80s, the success and tremendous political effect of Germany's Green Party, the nuclear catastrophes of Tschernobyl and Fukushima, and contemporary issues of food production and waste management.

disrupting her life, through analysis of dreams, symptoms, bungled actions, slips of the tongue, and repetitive behaviors.  Freud finds that these apparently irrational acts and behavior are ordered by the logic of the fantasy, which provides a mental representation of a taumatic childhood experience and the effects it unleashes in the mind and body-effects he called drives.  As \"unbound\" energies, the drives give rise to symptoms, repetitive acts, and fantasmatic stagings that menace our health and sometimes threaten social coexistence, but that also rise to the desires, creative acts, and social projects we identify as the essence of human life.  Readings will include fundamental texts on the unconscious, repression, fantasy, and the death drive, as well as case studies and speculative essays on mythology, art, religion, and group psychology.  Students will be asked to keep a dream journal and to work on their unconscious formations, and will have the chance to produce creative projects as well as analytic essays.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(KCM-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":364699,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"3620","titleShort":"Intro

Kafka, and Beckett). Established in 1920s at the Institute for Social Research, the assorted circle of scholars comprising the Frankfurt School played a pivotal role in the intellectual developments of post-war American and European political and aesthetic theory. Often known simply as \"Critical Theory,\" their key works cover a vast array of intellectual, political, economic, and artistic concerns, from the dialectic of enlightenment to commentaries on popular culture, high art, commodity fetishism, and mass society.

This also entails an introduction, for non-specialists, to essential problems of political economy, continental philosophy, psychology, and literary and cultural criticism. Second, we compare the underlying assumptions and the interpretive yields of the various disciplines and practices founded by Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud: historical materialism and communism, existentialism and power-knowledge analysis, and psychoanalysis, respectively.

to imagine implications of the absolutist legacy for civil society and the emerging bureaucratic state.  Other sessions will be devoted to nineteenth-century opera, focusing on responses to the French Revolution and the changing role of the masses and \"the people\" (Grand opéra, Wagner), before turning to the years immediately before and during World War II, ranging from the Zeitoper of the 1920s

attention to his main sources, e.g., Croce, Dante, Lenin, Marx, Machiavelli); and then to trace main directions of the Gramscian legacy in philosophy, political theory and practice, and cultural theory and practice (notably filmmaking).  This legacy includes the works of Aijaz Ahmad, Louis Althusser, Christine Buci-Glucksmann, Norberto Bobbio, Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe, and Pier-Paolo

the world than the end of capitalism? What prevents us from joining oppositions to capitalism after the 2008-09 economic crisis? Have all utopias died with state socialism? How does advertising sell the current dystopia as \"cool capitalism\"? And what roles do race and gender play? This seminar examines fictions (written and cinematic) that maintain but also contest global capitalism as the dominant social, economic, and political order. With Marx's and later Marxist writings, we consider such \"fables\" as Roland Barthes, Mythologies; Thomas Pynchon, The Crying of Lot 49; David Fincher, Fight Club; and Lizzie Borden, Born in Flames. Analyzing these texts and constructing arguments about them will hone our analytical reading and critical writing skills.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":367077,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"1150","titleShort":"FWS: German Lyric Poetry","titleLong":"FWS: German Lyric Poetry","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17667,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"km393","firstName":"Klas Erik","middleName":"","lastName":"Molde"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 348","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH348","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"FWS Session"}],"description":"Friedrich Hölderlin, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Paul Celan are arguably the most influential lyric poets to have written in German.  Although each responded to events of his day (the French Revolution, First World War, and Second World War, respectively), they all aspired to transcend their immediate contexts. Their success is indicated by the interest prominent philosophers have taken in their work and the many musical settings their poetry has inspired.

This course explores seriality in literature and popular culture (television, film, new media) and examines the strategies of suspense, entertainment, and anticipation that connect installments or episodes into novels, seasons, series, and franchises.

Film noir of the 1940s and 50s offered mass audiences a critical view of U.S. society, and exiled directors were often ambivalent about their new home, an attitude reflected in films such as Scarlet Street (1945), Detour (1945), and Criss Cross (1949). We will also discuss more recent films with surprising links to both film noir and German expressionism, including Blue Velvet (1986), Dark City (1998), and The Big Lebowski (1998).

Two main questions guide the course: what are the key patterns of argument related to time in the Western tradition? How did scientific knowledge, cross-cultural encounters and methodological disputes shape or change these patterns? The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were a period of rapid temporal expansion in both extent and detail: geology shifted the scale of time, and chronological work propelled claims for a truly \"universal\" history.  Departing from these developments, the course explores how temporal ideas have functioned within and shaped different disciplinary and institutional

We will focus particularly on the \"Wiener Moderne\" as a laboratory for the negotiation of the relationship between tradition and innovation (\"decadence\"), between art and life (\"aestheticism\"). This entails an exploration of experiments with literary language and form (short prose, essay, interior monologue) and of crucial concepts at the threshold of modernity: Sexuality and gender, history and myth, representation and the limits thereof, and, as the central, precarious and 'nervous' center: the decentered subject. \"Viennese modernism\" (including current critical standpoints) will be supplemented by the investigation of modernisms at the periphery of the Austrian Empire, i.e. Prague and Budapest, and of the so-called \"Berliner Moderne.

Philosophers and poets for a few thousand years have contemplated the close kinship between madness and genius and have engaged in lively discussions about changing definitions of creativity as either ingenuity, inspiration, or insanity; as stemming from divine possession, originality, or fanatic enthusiasm. By reading philosophical and medical treatises, by examining texts of fiction and lyric poetry, as well as by including historical accounts, this course will find out when and why our culture decided to call a madman a genius and a genius mad.

The guiding principle behind this writing seminar is that there is a relationship between the form of a particular sport – what happens on the field – and the fans it produces. The difference, then, between a Yankees and a Cowboys fan is not just a jersey, but a worldview. Students will practice academic writing skills by analyzing these worldviews as expressed in the books and films surrounding specific sports themselves. These will include Nick Hornby's Fever Pitch, Phil Alden Robinson's Field of Dreams, and Leni Riefenstahl's Olympia, as well as critical works by Immanuel Kant, Susan Sonntag, and Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"No knowledge of German is expected.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":368259,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"1117","titleShort":"FWS: Just Friends?","titleLong":"FWS: Just Friends?","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17908,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"es744","firstName":"Elke","middleName":"","lastName":"Siegel"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"White Hall 114","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT114","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-Year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"FWS Session"}],"description":"In popular culture and literature, in the humanities and in the social sciences, friendship – a relationship of choice without institutional foundation – is a topic that allows for the exploration of the concept of community.

In addition to the visual dimension of the female body, we will study the regulation and training of female actresses' voices and gestures to analyze how they complicate or enable female silence.

Ships transport goods, cars carry passengers, devices transmit information. While origins and destinations often seem the most significant, modern media and cultural mobility also invite us to consider the experience of being in transit, of what happens as things move from point A to point B. This course examines the function of media in processes of mobilization and immobilization through readings in travel writing and cultural theory (e.g., Goethe, Kafka, Seghers, Simmel, Benjamin, Kracauer). Our guiding questions will include: What kinds of situations tend to create mobility or immobility? To what extent do technologies like the telegraph, telephone, and radio contribute to increased mobility and global connections? And what might studying the experience of mobility and transition reveal about the project of modernity itself?","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Taught in

disrupting her life, through analysis of dreams, symptoms, bungled actions, slips of the tongue, and repetitive behaviors.  Freud finds that these apparently irrational acts and behavior are ordered by the logic of the fantasy, which provides a mental representation of a taumatic childhood experience and the effects it unleashes in the mind and body-effects he called drives.  As \"unbound\" energies, the drives give rise to symptoms, repetitive acts, and fantasmatic stagings that menace our health and sometimes threaten social coexistence, but that also rise to the desires, creative acts, and social projects we identify as the essence of human life.  Readings will include fundamental texts on the unconscious, repression, fantasy, and the death drive, as well as case studies and speculative essays on mythology, art, religion, and group psychology.  Students will be asked to keep a dream journal and to work on their unconscious formations, and will have the chance to produce creative projects as well as analytic essays.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(KCM-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":351343,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"4100","titleShort":"The

magic to climb the social ladder get transformed into moral lessons for children?  The answer lies in Romanticism and its appropriation of the imagination as a force for social transformation.  As Romantics edited older tales for juvenile consumption they wrote new ones for adults. This new fiction created the matrix for modern pop genres like fantasy, science-fiction, murder mysteries, and gothic horror.  To understand this paradigm shift in modern culture, we will read, discuss, and write about a variety of texts the Romantics collected, composed, or inspired, including poetry and film, in addition to classic fairy tales and academic scholarship on the topic.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"No knowledge of German is expected.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368258,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"1115","titleShort":"FWS: Sports Fanaticism","titleLong":"FWS: Sports Fanaticism","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17452,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mdc249","firstName":"Matteo","middleName":"Donald","lastName":"Calla"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"White Hall B06","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHTB06","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-Year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"FWS Session"}],"description":"Sports are never just entertainment. They also create communities of fans – fanatics –with values and rituals that closely resemble religious movements. The guiding principle behind this writing seminar is that there is a relationship between the form of a particular sport – what happens on the field – and the fans it produces. The difference, then, between a Yankees and a Cowboys fan is not just a jersey, but a worldview. Students will practice academic writing skills by analyzing these worldviews as expressed in the books and films surrounding specific sports themselves. These will include Nick Hornby's Fever Pitch, Phil Alden Robinson's Field of Dreams, and Leni Riefenstahl's Olympia, as well as critical works by Immanuel Kant, Susan Sonntag, and Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"No knowledge of German is expected.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368261,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"1118","titleShort":"FWS: Let's Play!","titleLong":"FWS: Let's Play!","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17456,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ep399","firstName":"Ekaterina","middleName":"","lastName":"Pirozhenko"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 144","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH144","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-Year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"FWS Session"}],"description":"Why do we play games and why do we have fun with them?

Texts include novels and novellas: the Trial, the Castle, America, the Penal Colony, Metamorphoses, the Judgment, the Country Doctor, The Burrow, Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk. Films by the Coen brothers and David Lynch; theoretical readings by Camus, Lacan, Deleuze, Guattari, Bataille, Blanchot, Benjamin, Kierkegaard and others; this course will also examine Kafka's library and discuss a number of authors who influenced his work: Flaubert, Balzac, Cervantes, Hamsun, Tolstoi, Perez, Dostojewski.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Readings and discussions in English. Students proficient in German at the upper intermediate level or higher may opt to do a substantial portion of the reading in German.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":357615,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"4250","titleShort":"Marx, Nietzsche, Freud","titleLong":"Marx, Nietzsche, Freud","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16378,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"gcw1","firstName":"Geoffrey","middleName":"Carter W","lastName":"Waite"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Baker Laboratory 335","bldgDescr":"Baker Laboratory","facilityDescrshort":"BKL335","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This is a lecture course, but there will be plenty of time for discussion.

This also entails an introduction, for non-specialists, to essential problems of political economy, continental philosophy, psychology, and literary and cultural criticism. Second, we compare the underlying assumptions and the interpretive yields of the various disciplines and practices founded by Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud: historical materialism and communism, existentialism and power-knowledge analysis, and psychoanalysis, respectively.

Taking its cue from the \"digital turn,\" this course rephrases a traditional question asked in film theory about the nature of the medium (What is film?) in terms of a historical question: What was film when it was still something to be cut, wound up, and carried around, a thing with a literally explosive potential? Reframing the object of study in this manner will help situate familiar narrative cinema within more unfamiliar scientific, aesthetic, and experimental contexts. Early film theorists saw great potential in the new medium, thought to be capable of conveying a new experience of movement and time, creating a new art of light and shadow, or functioning as a new kind of scientific instrument. Screenings will put readings of early film theory in dialogue with early European silent films that address similar concerns about the nature of cinema, such as A Trip to the Moon (1902), The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926), and Man with a Movie Camera (1929).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Taught in English.

This course will interrogate the basis of this assumption by focusing on the voice as a trained cultural technique.  In this course, we will look at the history of this topic from Plato to Nietzsche through close critical readings of literary and philosophical depictions of listening and acoustic performances up to and prior to the age of the phonograph. How did philosophers, pastors, and poets describe, observe, imagine sound before sounds could be recorded? Were there particular modes of listening or speaking more appropriate for the \"right\" kind of literary or philosophical understanding? How did listening intersect with the visual apprehension of the printed page, painting or sculpture? How do vocal techniques construct either a national culture or other types of communities? Readings will include texts by Plato, Lucretius, Augustine, Rousseau, Goethe, Klopstock, Herder, Nietzsche, Michel de Certeau, Friedrich Kittler, Michel Chion, and Walter

In this course, we will investigate the emergence of writing a self out of practices such as ascetic (in the Foucauldian sense) self-exploration and confession and the risks of introspection under conditions of secularization. We will explore theories of the autobiographical but also ask what kind of artistic practices and theoretical fields have emerged from genres like autobiography or diary (projects like cartographies in Perec or Ernaux; notions like aesthetics or ethics of everyday life). What stabilizing or destabilizing functions does writing the self serve? Is the ‚I' merely framed by narrative conventions, space and time (Blanchot), or can it find ways to mediate self and world, individual and society in writing?","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":351368,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"6320","titleShort":"Reading Academic German II","titleLong":"Reading Academic German II","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":5861,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:05AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":6,"netid":"mm2679","firstName":"Matthias","middleName":"","lastName":"Mueller"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 181","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH181","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Limited to graduate students.

How do images produce meaning? How has vision been defined historically and methodologically? How has visual culture been construed theoretically? Our goal will be to sketch the genealogical trajectories that comprise visual studies as a field of investigation by focusing on concerns that have shaped larger theoretical debates on the politics and ethics of representation, including mimesis, realism, perspective, the interplay of word and image, attention, spectacle, and surveillance. Readings will be drawn from influential works in visual theory, cultural semiotics and anthropology, media studies, and the science of vision. They may include texts by Alpers, Bal, Barthes, Crary, Elkins, Foucault, Haraway, Jay, Livingstone, Merleau-Ponty, Mitchell, Stafford, Panofski, Ranciere, and Virilio, among

Philosophers and poets for a few thousand years have contemplated the close kinship between madness and genius and have engaged in lively discussions about changing definitions of creativity as either ingenuity, inspiration, or insanity; as stemming from divine possession, originality, or fanatic enthusiasm. By reading philosophical and medical treatises, by examining texts of fiction and lyric poetry, as well as by including historical accounts, this course will find out when and why our culture decided to call a madman a genius and a genius mad. We shall trace the history of social and artistic transgression and analyze when and why a culture considers great talent as \"too different,\" as \"pathological,\" or as \"un-normal.\" You shall read texts ranging from Antiquity to the 18th and 20th centuries and encounter authors from Germany, France, Britain, and the United States.

This new fiction created the matrix for modern pop genres like fantasy, science-fiction, murder mysteries, and gothic horror.  To understand this paradigm shift in modern culture, we will read, discuss, and write about a variety of texts the Romantics collected, composed, or inspired, including poetry and film, in addition to classic fairy tales and academic scholarship on the topic.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"No knowledge of German is expected.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":368261,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"1118","titleShort":"FWS: Let's Play!","titleLong":"FWS: Let's Play!","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17609,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ep399","firstName":"Ekaterina","middleName":"","lastName":"Pirozhenko"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-Year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"FWS Session"}],"description":"Why do we play games and why do we have fun with them?

Yet since World War II, his influence, his reputation, and his fascination for scholars in a wide range of cultural and political disciplines has steadily grown. He is seen as a bridging figure between German and Jewish studies, between materialist critique of culture and the submerged yet powerful voice of theology, between literary history and philosophy. We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":351348,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"4520","titleShort":"Independent

philosophy to aesthetics.  This seminar will retrace the major steps of Holocaust history writing.  It will analyze the classical debates between \"intentionalism\" and \"functionalism,\" the discrepancies between the analytical approaches focused on the perpetrators and those focused on the victims, the inscription of the Holocaust into the broader context of war violence, and its comparison with the genocidal violence of colonialism.  Finally, it will investigate some methodological problems concerning the place of testimony in history writing and the permanent connections, both fruitful and problematic, between history and memory.  This means taking into account the entanglement of the most productive areas of Holocaust scholarship (Germany, France and the United States) as well as the relationship between the historiography of the Holocaust and other disciplines (memory studies, postcolonial studies,

Yet since World War II, his influence, his reputation, and his fascination for scholars in a wide range of cultural and political disciplines has steadily grown. He is seen as a bridging figure between German and Jewish studies, between materialist critique of culture and the submerged yet powerful voice of theology, between literary history and philosophy. We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":369034,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"6610","titleShort":"Fictions of Law: 18th Century","titleLong":"Fictions of Law: Literature, Philosophy, and Culture in the Long 18th Century","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17217,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"pg33","firstName":"Peter","middleName":"","lastName":"Gilgen"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Olin Library 403","bldgDescr":"Olin Library","facilityDescrshort":"OLL403","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Anchor course.

The main focus will be on the decay of old European norms and the establishment of new normative frameworks in the wake of the intensified functional differentiation of society that marks the 18th century. During this period, rule following and deviance are foregrounded in literature, ethics, and legal theory. Questions concerning the legitimacy of political change and revolution lead to a new understanding of the law; the state and society; the conscience of the individual; and the role of education and the arts.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Anchor course.  German reading knowledge is required.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":364702,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"6760","titleShort":"Alexander Kluge","titleLong":"Alexander Kluge, the Writer","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17125,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"laa10","firstName":"Leslie","middleName":"Allen","lastName":"Adelson"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Olin Library 403","bldgDescr":"Olin Library","facilityDescrshort":"OLL403","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Discussion in English.

Focusing on old and new narrative fictions in tension with the author's work in other media, this seminar: 1) introduces students to Kluge's literary oeuvre and 2) explores formal aspects of his writing in relation to critical theories of time, history, labor, utopia, science fiction, the public sphere, and more.

Besides attending the workshops, course participants meet with the instructor for two additional sessions devoted to pursuing the ties between the topics and disciplinary fields showcased by the speakers and the students' own work. The course is thus intended both as a survey of disciplinary approaches in German and Humanities Studies and as a framework that allows graduate students to hone professional skills (presenter and panel respondent, newsletter contributor, etc).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":351318,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"1210","titleShort":"Exploring German Contexts I","titleLong":"Exploring German Contexts I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":5641,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"gl15","firstName":"Gunhild","middleName":"Iris","lastName":"Lischke"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Intended for students with no prior experience in German or with LPG score below 37 or SAT II score below 370.

Hardly a unified theory, Posthumanism draws on a wide variety of precursors and inspirations—in the natural sciences, the philosophy and history of science, the social sciences, and different theory paradigms in the humanities. They all have in common the intention of transcending a worldview that is exclusively premised on human needs and measures. Thus, posthumanist theorizing in the widest sense includes many recent additions to the critical canon, such as eco-criticism and animal studies.

Topics to be discussed include the relationship between high-modernism, the avant-garde, and diverse forms of artistic engagement within the context of mass culture and mass politics; the articulation of gender, class, and racialized dimensions in cultural production and reception; and the challenge to traditional notions of authorship, representation, mimesis, and textuality mounted by the proliferation of text- and image-based mass media. Individual works will be drawn primarily from literature and drama, with a special emphasis placed on key concepts that helped define artistic production at this time (Expressionism, Dada, New Objectivity, Constructivism, montage, reportage, epic theater, etc.).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Anchor course.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA18"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":351379,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"6630","titleShort":"Nietzsche&Heidegger","titleLong":"Nietzsche and Heidegger","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16934,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"gcw1","firstName":"Geoffrey","middleName":"Carter W","lastName":"Waite"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"The readings are provided in German (and French or Italian in some cases) and in English translations, when these exist.

A major concern is the articulation of philosophy and politics, particularly in the case of Heidegger. We are also interested in the types of argumentation and styles of writing of both thinkers, including in light of the hypothesis that they were working in the ancient tradition of prudent exotericism, viz. that they never wrote exactly what they thought and that they intended their influence to come slightly beneath the level of conscious apprehension. We also consider their impact on the long list of intellectuals across the 'Left-Center-Right' spectrum, including (depending on seminar-participant interest): Adorno, Agamben, Bataille, Badiou, Bourdieu, Butler, Derrida, Deleuze, Foucault, Gadamer, Irigaray, Klossowski, Löwith, Marcuse, Rorty, Leo Strauss, Vattimo, Zupancic.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"","catalogComments":"The readings are provided in German (and French or Italian in some cases) and in English translations, when these exist.

Taking leave of a sociological model that interprets this literature as a plea for compassionate intercultural dialogue, this course juxtaposes prose fiction about cultural contact and critical theories of difference with two primary goals in mind. Students will be introduced to representative examples of contemporary German literatures of migration, and critical modes of conceptualizing cultural contact in Germany will be compared in relation to each other and in tension with the literary field. A focus on German literature of Turkish migration will be complemented by readings reflecting other transnational phenomena such as postsocialism, postcolonialism, and globalization.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: good reading knowledge of German and English required; exceptions require instructor approval.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: Graduate students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA18"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":367881,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"7000","titleShort":"PIRIP Independent Study","titleLong":"PIRIP Independent Study","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":8784,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"pf239","firstName":"Paul","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Fleming"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Independent Study for non-degree visiting graduate students accepted into the PIRIP."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":12,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2018","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":null,"catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA18"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":351386,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"7530","titleShort":"Independent Study","titleLong":"Independent Study","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":5682,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Prerequisite: permission of instructor.

Besides attending the workshops, course participants meet with the instructor for two additional sessions devoted to pursuing the ties between the topics and disciplinary fields showcased by the speakers and the students' own work. The course is thus intended both as a survey of disciplinary approaches in German and Humanities Studies and as a framework that allows graduate students to hone professional skills (presenter and panel respondent, newsletter contributor, etc).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA18"}]
