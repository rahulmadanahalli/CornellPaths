The Bible itself will be the primary text for the course, but students will also be exposed to the rich and diverse textual traditions of the ancient Near East, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, Moab, and Ugarit. In addition, this course will explore the impact of early biblical interpretation on shaping the monotheistic traditions inherited in the West. As participants in a secular course on the Bible, students will be challenged to question certain cultural assumptions about the composition and authorship of the Bible, and will be expected to differentiate between a text's content and its presumed meaning.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-ITL)","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":357489,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"2754","titleShort":"Wondrous Lit of Near East","titleLong":"Wondrous Literatures of the Near East","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":8973,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":6,"netid":"das86","firstName":"Deborah","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Starr"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"2754","type":"C"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"2754","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2018","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course examines Near East's rich and diverse literary heritage.

Starting with classic sitcoms (\"The Goldbergs\" (1948), \"All in the Family\", and \"Bridget Loves Bernie\"), and continuing through current Jewish TV shows (\"The Marvelous Ms. Maisel\", \"Transparent\", \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\"), as well as major theater landmarks (\"Fiddler on the Roof\", \"Cabaret\", \"Bad Jews\", \"Indecent\"), we will compare these constructed media images to concurrent political, historical and cultural trends.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":366422,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"4180","titleShort":"The Imaginary Jew","titleLong":"The Imaginary Jew: Roots of Antisemitism in Medieval England","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16749,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sz66","firstName":"Samantha","middleName":"","lastName":"Zacher"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"4180","type":"B"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"6180","type":"B"},{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"6180","type":"B"},{"subject":"MEDVL","catalogNbr":"4180","type":"B"},{"subject":"MEDVL","catalogNbr":"6180","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2018","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"When did anti-Semitism begin?
