Our attention will focus on the relationships and contexts from which particular Native American literatures emerge, and ethical considerations associated with entering Indigenous territory, both figuratively and literally.

From oral traditions transmitted through memory and mnemonics to contemporary innovations, Native North American authorial techniques layer Indigenous perspectives on social, political, and environmental experience, through deft artistry and place-specific aesthetics. Our attention will focus on the relationships and contexts from which particular Native American literatures emerge, and ethical considerations associated with entering Indigenous territory, both figuratively and literally. In response to a selection of traditional stories, fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and a graphic novel or two, we will examine how Native literatures voice scathing critiques of settler-colonial values and practices, and yet challenge, delight, and intrigue their readers.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AG, D-AG, LA-AG)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":361756,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AIIS","catalogNbr":"3330","titleShort":"IndigenousPlace-BasedEcolKnowl","titleLong":"Ways of Knowing: Indigenous and Place-Based Ecological Knowledge","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":4176,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"ksk28","firstName":"Karim-Aly","middleName":"Saleh","lastName":"Kassam"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Enrollment limited to: Juniors, seniors, and grad students.
