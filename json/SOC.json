of society (e.g., population, the economy) and the sweeping changes that have occurred within them over the past couple of centuries.  Particular attention will be paid to changes in social cohesion, the division of labor, the spatial organization of society, and technology. These theories, which are covered in the first two segments of the course, provide some insight into where society is going and what challenges have emerged along the way.  In the third segment of the course, we will look more closely at the role of individuals and everyday interaction in the genesis of social phenomena.  We will explore theories about what motivates individuals' social behavior, the role of rationality and emotion, how the micromechanics of interpersonal contact can shape larger society, and the subtle links between biological and social processes.  In the final segment of the course, we will explore complex webs that emerge through social actors' connections to each other, and how these network structures have been shaped by the various processes that were examined during the semester.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"Forbidden Overlap: Students may not receive credit for both SOC 1101 and DSOC 1101.","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":359378,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"2090","titleShort":"Networks","titleLong":"Networks","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":7928,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dae3","firstName":"David","middleName":"","lastName":"Easley"},{"instrAssignSeq":11,"netid":"jmk6","firstName":"Jon","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Kleinberg"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"Statler Hall 185-Aud","bldgDescr":"Statler Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STL185","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"CS","catalogNbr":"2850","type":"B"},{"subject":"ECON","catalogNbr":"2040","type":"B"},{"subject":"INFO","catalogNbr":"2040","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This interdisciplinary course examines network structures and how they matter in everyday life.

Most importantly, unlike 2580, 4580 is not about the books; rather, it is about how to teach the books.  Much of our in-class analysis of the books centers on identifying what are the key contributions to knowledge, as well as important limitations, and how best to communicate these ideas to students with little background in the social sciences. All students are provided the opportunity to lead one or more discussion groups in 2580.  In addition to facilitating metacognitive understanding of the books, the seminar has two additional goals: 1) to provide advanced undergraduates with an opportunity to summon, integrate, and apply insights that they have acquired over the course of their undergraduate education as they analyze arguments from the standpoint of multiple social sciences, and 2) to integrate scholarship across disciplinary lines, a major goal of University Courses.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"A University Course - This class highlights cross-disciplinary dialogue and debate.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: At least one statistics course.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment is limited to: majors in either Human Development, Psychology, Sociology, or Economics.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":351101,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"4780","titleShort":"Family & Society in Africa","titleLong":"The Family and Society in Africa","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":8602,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:35PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"na12","firstName":"N'Dri","middleName":"Therese","lastName":"Assie-Lumumba"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Africana Ctr B07","bldgDescr":"Africana Ctr","facilityDescrshort":"AFCB07","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"4606","type":"B"},{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"6066","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"\"The family, as a social institution, is structured according to historical, socio-economic, political, and cultural factors.

These theories, which are covered in the first two segments of the course, provide some insight into where society is going and what challenges have emerged along the way.  In the third segment of the course, we will look more closely at the role of individuals and everyday interaction in the genesis of social phenomena.  We will explore theories about what motivates individuals' social behavior, the role of rationality and emotion, how the micromechanics of interpersonal contact can shape larger society, and the subtle links between biological and social processes.  In the final segment of the course, we will explore complex webs that emerge through social actors' connections to each other, and how these network structures have been shaped by the various processes that were examined during the semester.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"Forbidden Overlap: Students may not receive credit for both SOC 1101 and DSOC

of society (e.g., population, the economy) and the sweeping changes that have occurred within them over the past couple of centuries.  Particular attention will be paid to changes in social cohesion, the division of labor, the spatial organization of society, and technology. These theories, which are covered in the first two segments of the course, provide some insight into where society is going and what challenges have emerged along the way.  In the third segment of the course, we will look more closely at the role of individuals and everyday interaction in the genesis of social phenomena.  We will explore theories about what motivates individuals' social behavior, the role of rationality and emotion, how the micromechanics of interpersonal contact can shape larger society, and the subtle links between biological and social processes.  In the final segment of the course, we will explore complex webs that emerge through social actors' connections to each other, and how these network structures have been shaped by the various processes that were examined during the semester.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"Forbidden Overlap: Students may not receive credit for both SOC 1101 and DSOC 1101.","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":354646,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"2190","titleShort":"Intro To Economic Sociology","titleLong":"Introduction to Economic Sociology","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":8948,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"vgn1","firstName":"Victor","middleName":"","lastName":"Nee"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Malott Hall 406","bldgDescr":"Malott Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MLT406","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"What is the driving force behind economic growth? How do people find jobs? Does culture matter for economic action? What exactly is a market? Why is there a concentration of high-tech firms in Silicon Valley? Why has entrepreneurial capitalism emerged in China? These are some of the questions that this course will explore through the theoretical lens of economic sociology. Economic sociology has sought to understand the beliefs, norms, and institutions that shape and drive the global economy. It has sought to extend the sociological approach to the study of economic life by studying the interactions between social structure and economic action. The systematic application of sociological reasoning to explain economic action involves analysis of the ways in which social networks, norms, and institutions matter in economic transactions. The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to economic sociology as an approach and research program to understand and explain the relationship between economy and society in the modern era.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":354697,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"2206","titleShort":"International Development","titleLong":"International Development","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":5796,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:00AM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":6,"netid":"pdm1","firstName":"Philip","middleName":"David","lastName":"McMichael"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Warren Hall 151","bldgDescr":"Warren Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WRN151","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Juniors and Seniors may choose to take course for 1 additional credit if selected from applicant pool during first week of class.

This course considers development as an evolving world project and from the perspective of its social and ecological impact: asking questions about costs and benefits of economic growth, about the global context (geo-political, institutional, production, consumption, and discursive relations), and the sustainability of various models. We relate development trends in the South/Third World with those in the North/First World. We also examine shared, global issues, such as the environment, human rights, security, and their condition in different parts of the world. In examining development historically, we encourage students to situate trends shaping the twenty-first century world, and how they can contribute, as global citizens, to the ongoing debate about how to reformulate development as an inclusive an empowering social process.\nThis course combines Lectures with discussion, and uses films and section discussions to promote reflection on diversity of cultures and understandings of human development. It also includes a special component (access by instructor permission), in conjunction with Cornell's Writing in the Majors Program. This is worth an additional credit hour, and is for advanced students. These students will meet additionally in weekly Sections with a Writing Instructor from Development Sociology for a special topic focus to enhance understanding of course material as well as writing

Within each of the broad topics explored in the course, we seek to achieve three central objectives: (1) to examine some of the most salient features of Korean society; (2) to explore the differences and similarities between Korea and other developing and developed countries; (3) to discuss some of the key problems that Korea has to face in the near future, and research agendas posed by these problems.

In this course, students will use the Obama presidency to think, talk, and write about how race works in America. We'll examine the symbolism of Obama's personal narrative and biracialism to analyze his race-neutral campaigns and governing within the context of history, politics, and policies.

To frame this question, the course embarks upon a comparative historical analysis of industrialization to determine where society may be heading.

We begin with the basics of linear regression, including estimation, statistical inference, and model assumptions. We then review several tools for diagnosing violations of statistical assumptions and what to do when things go wrong, including dealing with outliers, missing data, omitted variables, and weights. Finally, we will explore extensions of the linear regression model, including models for categorical outcomes and hierarchical linear modeling. While statistical modeling is the focus of the course, we proceed with the assumption that models are only as good as the theoretical and substantive knowledge behind them. Thus, in covering the technical material, we will spend considerable time discussing the link between substantive knowledge and statistical practice. The course is designed primarily for graduate students in sociology.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":354727,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"6070","titleShort":"Sociology Colloquium","titleLong":"Sociology Colloquium","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":7497,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"03:00PM","timeEnd":"05:30PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 302","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH302","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/UnSat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory - Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"A series of talks representative of current research interests in sociology, given by distinguished visitors and faculty members.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Requirement for sociology graduate students.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":351218,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"6310","titleShort":"Qualit Res Methods Study Sci","titleLong":"Qualitative Research Methods for Studying Science","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":5792,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"cal22","firstName":"Christine","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Leuenberger"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Rockefeller Hall B15","bldgDescr":"Rockefeller Hall","facilityDescrshort":"RCKB15","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"STS","catalogNbr":"6311","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"In this Graduate seminar we will discuss the nature, politics and basic assumptions underlying qualitative research.

Among many issues to be addressed are: the relationship of this conflict to the history of European colonialism in the Middle East, the emergence of Pan-Arabism and Islamism, the various currents in Zionism and its relationship to Judaism, the implication of great power rivalry in the Middle East, the different causes and political repercussions of the four Arab-Israeli wars, efforts at peacemaking including Oslo and Camp David, and the significance of the two Palestinian uprisings.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":363071,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"4470","titleShort":"Families & Social Inequality","titleLong":"Families and Social Inequality","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17256,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"kam386","firstName":"Kelly","middleName":"","lastName":"Musick"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall 153","bldgDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MVR153","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"PAM","catalogNbr":"4470","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Disparities in family life are widening in the United States, with important implications for the well-being of family members and the reproduction of inequality from one generation to the next.

How can we understand the interaction of society and technology?

These theories, which are covered in the first two segments of the course, provide some insight into where society is going and what challenges have emerged along the way.  In the third segment of the course, we will look more closely at the role of individuals and everyday interaction in the genesis of social phenomena.  We will explore theories about what motivates individuals' social behavior, the role of rationality and emotion, how the micromechanics of interpersonal contact can shape larger society, and the subtle links between biological and social processes.  In the final segment of the course, we will explore complex webs that emerge through social actors' connections to each other, and how these network structures have been shaped by the various processes that were examined during the semester.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"Forbidden Overlap: Students may not receive credit for both SOC 1101 and DSOC

of society (e.g., population, the economy) and the sweeping changes that have occurred within them over the past couple of centuries.  Particular attention will be paid to changes in social cohesion, the division of labor, the spatial organization of society, and technology. These theories, which are covered in the first two segments of the course, provide some insight into where society is going and what challenges have emerged along the way.  In the third segment of the course, we will look more closely at the role of individuals and everyday interaction in the genesis of social phenomena.  We will explore theories about what motivates individuals' social behavior, the role of rationality and emotion, how the micromechanics of interpersonal contact can shape larger society, and the subtle links between biological and social processes.  In the final segment of the course, we will explore complex webs that emerge through social actors' connections to each other, and how these network structures have been shaped by the various processes that were examined during the semester.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"Forbidden Overlap: Students may not receive credit for both SOC 1101 and DSOC 1101.","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":367980,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"1900","titleShort":"Discussions of Justice","titleLong":"Discussions of Justice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18739,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"08:30PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"apd48","firstName":"Austin","middleName":"Paul","lastName":"Duggan"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rwm5","firstName":"Richard","middleName":"William","lastName":"Miller"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Carl Becker House G32","bldgDescr":"Carl Becker House","facilityDescrshort":"BKRG32","meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This semester's theme will be inequalities in the United States, political, economic, racial, social and educational.

How do people find jobs? Does culture matter for economic action? What exactly is a market? Why is there a concentration of high-tech firms in Silicon Valley? Why has entrepreneurial capitalism emerged in China? These are some of the questions that this course will explore through the theoretical lens of economic sociology. Economic sociology has sought to understand the beliefs, norms, and institutions that shape and drive the global economy. It has sought to extend the sociological approach to the study of economic life by studying the interactions between social structure and economic action. The systematic application of sociological reasoning to explain economic action involves analysis of the ways in which social networks, norms, and institutions matter in economic transactions. The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to economic sociology as an approach and research program to understand and explain the relationship between economy and society in the modern era.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":354697,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"2206","titleShort":"International Development","titleLong":"International Development","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":5270,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:00AM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":6,"netid":"pdm1","firstName":"Philip","middleName":"David","lastName":"McMichael"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Warren Hall 151","bldgDescr":"Warren Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WRN151","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Juniors and Seniors may choose to take course for 1 additional credit if selected from applicant pool during first week of class.

This course considers development as an evolving world project and from the perspective of its social and ecological impact: asking questions about costs and benefits of economic growth, about the global context (geo-political, institutional, production, consumption, and discursive relations), and the sustainability of various models. We relate development trends in the South/Third World with those in the North/First World. We also examine shared, global issues, such as the environment, human rights, security, and their condition in different parts of the world. In examining development historically, we encourage students to situate trends shaping the twenty-first century world, and how they can contribute, as global citizens, to the ongoing debate about how to reformulate development as an inclusive an empowering social process.\nThis course combines Lectures with discussion, and uses films and section discussions to promote reflection on diversity of cultures and understandings of human development. It also includes a special component (access by instructor permission), in conjunction with Cornell's Writing in the Majors Program. This is worth an additional credit hour, and is for advanced students. These students will meet additionally in weekly Sections with a Writing Instructor from Development Sociology for a special topic focus to enhance understanding of course material as well as writing skills.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-SBY)","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Discuss

industrialism societies?  Is there a \"ruling class?\"  Are lifestyles, attitudes, and personalities shaped fundamentally by class membership?  Can individuals born into poverty readily escape their class origins and move upward in the class structure?  Are social contacts and \"luck\" important forces in matching individuals to jobs and class positions?  What types of social processes serve to

course is to understand the relationship between education and society, with an emphasis on exploring educational inequality. To accomplish this, we will ask questions such as: What is the purpose and product of schools? How do schools reproduce social class, racial, and gender inequality? What is the relationship between education and future success? How are schools structured? What factors increase educational success? To answer these, and related questions, we will use classical and contemporary sociological theory and research.

We'll consider both qualitative and quantitative research on social life and health, with an eye toward identifying the strengths and weaknesses of various methodological approaches and gaps in current knowledge. The second component of this course is focused on the development of your own research regarding the relationship between social context and health. You'll explore this using data from a population-based social survey. Class instruction for this portion of the course will cover research question development, the statistical analysis of survey data, and social scientific writing.

Through these cases, students will learn about (1) the social-psychological and collective dynamics that govern behavior in disaster situations, (2) the role social networks and organizations play in disaster occurrence, response and recovery, and especially (3) the role of social disadvantage in shaping vulnerability to and mortality risk in disasters.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":366540,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"3850","titleShort":"Mass Incarceration & Family","titleLong":"Mass Incarceration and Family Life Course","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16914,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"arh96","firstName":"Anna","middleName":"R.","lastName":"Haskins"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 438","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH438","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The goal of this course is to provide a more complete analysis of the effects of mass imprisonment on urban family and community life.

These populations are difficult to sample using standard survey research methods because they lack a sampling frame, that is, an exhaustive list of population members from which the sample can be drawn and constructing a sampling frame is not feasible due to the closed nature of the populations networks or associated factors. Populations with these characteristics are important to studies of public health (e.g., drug users and commercial sex workers), public policy (e.g., immigrants and the homeless), and arts and culture (e.g., jazz musicians and aging artists). This course will survey the use of network-based approaches to sample populations and study the structure of social networks. The focus will range from initial work on biased network theory, through various approaches based on snowball sampling, the \"random-walk\" approach, adaptive sampling, and link-tracing designs, to a principal focus on respondent-driven sampling (RDS), including the analytics underlying that method, operational procedures, recent work extending the method, the potential for use of RDS to study the structure of very large social networks, and open areas in which further work is continuing and alternative formulations are emerging.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":358029,"crseOfferNbr":4,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"6430","titleShort":"Topics Social & Political Phil","titleLong":"Topics in Social and Political Philosophy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16689,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"rwm5","firstName":"Richard","middleName":"William","lastName":"Miller"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Stimson Hall 206","bldgDescr":"Stimson Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STM206","meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Inequalities: Economic, Political, Social,& Racial"}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4655","type":"B"},{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"6656","type":"B"},{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"4655","type":"B"},{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"6656","type":"B"},{"subject":"PHIL","catalogNbr":"4470","type":"B"},{"subject":"PHIL","catalogNbr":"6430","type":"B"},{"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"4430","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Advanced discussion of a topic in social and political philosophy.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":354729,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"6910","titleShort":"Independent Study","titleLong":"Independent Study","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":6214,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"For graduates who wish to obtain research experience or to do extensive reading on a special topic.

This course considers development as an evolving world project and from the perspective of its social and ecological impact: asking questions about costs and benefits of economic growth, about the global context (geo-political, institutional, production, consumption, and discursive relations), and the sustainability of various models. We relate development trends in the South/Third World with those in the North/First World. We also examine shared, global issues, such as the environment, human rights, security, and their condition in different parts of the world. In examining development historically, we encourage students to situate trends shaping the twenty-first century world, and how they can contribute, as global citizens, to the ongoing debate about how to reformulate development as an inclusive an empowering social process.\nThis course combines Lectures with discussion, and uses films and section discussions to promote reflection on diversity of cultures and understandings of human development. It also includes a special component (access by instructor permission), in conjunction with Cornell's Writing in the Majors Program. This is worth an additional credit hour, and is for advanced students. These students will meet additionally in weekly Sections with a Writing Instructor from Development Sociology for a special topic focus to enhance understanding of course material as well as writing skills.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-SBY)","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Discuss

start you thinking sociologically about yourself and the broader social world.  To think sociologically is to recognize that being embedded in the world constrains behavior, and that individuals are both social actors and social products.  To think sociologically is also to recognize that our contemporary world, with its enduring cultural, political, and economic institutions, is as much a social product as we are.  We will begin by covering theoretical and methodological foundations of the sociological perspective.  We will go on to explore the concept of social stratification and will survey primary axes of social difference.  In the second half of the course we will look more closely at how individuals relate to each other, how social inequality is enacted and reinforced in everyday life, and at the way in which the organization of social life shapes individuals and groups, such as through social networks, residential neighborhoods, schooling, families, and on-line

How do people find jobs? Does culture matter for economic action? What exactly is a market? Why is there a concentration of high-tech firms in Silicon Valley? Why has entrepreneurial capitalism emerged in China? These are some of the questions that this course will explore through the theoretical lens of economic sociology. Economic sociology has sought to understand the beliefs, norms, and institutions that shape and drive the global economy. It has sought to extend the sociological approach to the study of economic life by studying the interactions between social structure and economic action. The systematic application of sociological reasoning to explain economic action involves analysis of the ways in which social networks, norms, and institutions matter in economic transactions. The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to economic sociology as an approach and research program to understand and explain the relationship between economy and society in the modern era.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":354696,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"2202","titleShort":"Population Dynamics","titleLong":"Population Dynamics","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":7777,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":7,"netid":"sh104","firstName":"Sarah","middleName":"Carissa","lastName":"Giroux"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Warren Hall 151","bldgDescr":"Warren Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WRN151","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"If this course is full, please contact Cindy Twardokus at ct259@cornell.edu to be placed on a waitlist."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"DSOC","catalogNbr":"2010","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Introduction to population studies.

with growing income inequality, with the increasing visibility of inter-country differences in wealth and income, and with the persistence of racial, ethnic, and gender stratification. This course introduces students to ongoing social scientific debates about the sources and consequences of inequality, as well as the types of public policy that might appropriately be pursued to reduce (or increase) inequality. These topics will be addressed in related units, some of which include guest lectures by faculty from other universities (funded by the Center for the Study of Inequality). Each unit culminates with a highly spirited class discussion and debate.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":354659,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"2480","titleShort":"Politics&Culture","titleLong":"Politics and Culture","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17437,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:00AM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mmb39","firstName":"Mabel","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Berezin"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Rockefeller Hall 115","bldgDescr":"Rockefeller Hall","facilityDescrshort":"RCK115","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"201","classNbr":17438,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:00AM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mmb39","firstName":"Mabel","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Berezin"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Rockefeller Hall 128","bldgDescr":"Rockefeller Hall","facilityDescrshort":"RCK128","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"202","classNbr":17439,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"03:35PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mmb39","firstName":"Mabel","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Berezin"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall G24","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URHG24","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC","DIS"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"3633","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Focuses on currently salient themes of nationalism, multiculturalism, and democracy.

Accordingly, it is co-taught with psychologist Steve Ceci, and is organized around highly controversial \"must-read\" books on diverse topics that expose students to fundamental puzzles about human behavior and social interaction. The readings, combined with guest lectures by the authors, introduce students to disciplinary similarities and differences in the perspectives, theories, concepts, assumptions, and methods used by sociologists (who focus on what happens between individuals) and psychologists (who focus on what happens within). The authors vary from year to year but include Malcolm Gladwell, Michelle Alexander, Nate Silver, and Nicholas Christakis. All authors have agreed to participate in a \"Q&amp;A\" session with the students.

Yet, while not usually on our minds when thinking about governance and regulation, these seemingly mundane technologies are important features of our lives. This course will take a closer look at everyday solutions to public problems. Combining hands-on exercises with readings from STS, sociology, and politics, we shall explore the role of everyday devices and technologies in establishing, maintaining, and disrupting social order.

The intent is to provide seniors with an opportunity to summon, integrate, and apply insights that they have acquired over the course of their undergraduate education, and give prospective graduate students the opportunity to lead discussions in a large introductory lecture course, \"Six Pretty Good Books\" (HD/ILRLR/COMM/SOC 2580). Each seminar member is part of a two or three-person team that leads the discussion together, under the supervision of a graduate teaching assistant. Seminar meetings are devoted to building lesson plans for leading an effective discussion of each of the six books. The authors vary from year to year but include Malcolm Gladwell, Michelle Alexander, Nate Silver, and Nicholas Christakis. All authors have agreed to participate in a \"Q&amp;A\" session with the students which seminar members are required to attend. The course meets Cornell's SBA distribution requirement.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: HD 2580 or SOC 2580 or COMM 2580 or ILRLR 2580.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":365768,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"4860","titleShort":"Through the Prison Threshold","titleLong":"Through the Prison Threshold","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":9498,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ceg97","firstName":"Chris","middleName":"","lastName":"Garces"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 302","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH302","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"4071","type":"C"},{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"4867","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar will explore the rise of mass incarceration and punitive containment strategies around the globe.

Emphasis will be given to works that shed light on the professional and religious vocations that straddle prison worlds and the world beyond the prison walls, helping to generate new ethical

start you thinking sociologically about yourself and the broader social world.  To think sociologically is to recognize that being embedded in the world constrains behavior, and that individuals are both social actors and social products.  To think sociologically is also to recognize that our contemporary world, with its enduring cultural, political, and economic institutions, is as much a social product as we are.  We will begin by covering theoretical and methodological foundations of the sociological perspective.  We will go on to explore the concept of social stratification and will survey primary axes of social difference.  In the second half of the course we will look more closely at how individuals relate to each other, how social inequality is enacted and reinforced in everyday life, and at the way in which the organization of social life shapes individuals and groups, such as through social networks, residential neighborhoods, schooling, families, and on-line communication.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"Forbidden Overlap: Students may not receive credit for both SOC 1101 and DSOC

This course considers development as an evolving world project and from the perspective of its social and ecological impact: asking questions about costs and benefits of economic growth, about the global context (geo-political, institutional, production, consumption, and discursive relations), and the sustainability of various models. We relate development trends in the South/Third World with those in the North/First World. We also examine shared, global issues, such as the environment, human rights, security, and their condition in different parts of the world. In examining development historically, we encourage students to situate trends shaping the twenty-first century world, and how they can contribute, as global citizens, to the ongoing debate about how to reformulate development as an inclusive an empowering social process.\nThis course combines Lectures with discussion, and uses films and section discussions to promote reflection on diversity of cultures and understandings of human development. It also includes a special component (access by instructor permission), in conjunction with Cornell's Writing in the Majors Program. This is worth an additional credit hour, and is for advanced students. These students will meet additionally in weekly Sections with a Writing Instructor from Development Sociology for a special topic focus to enhance understanding of course material as well as writing

industrialism societies?  Is there a \"ruling class?\"  Are lifestyles, attitudes, and personalities shaped fundamentally by class membership?  Can individuals born into poverty readily escape their class origins and move upward in the class structure?  Are social contacts and \"luck\" important forces in matching individuals to jobs and class positions?  What types of social processes serve to

Has America entered a post-racial society in which racism and inequality are things of the past? Or does Obama's post-Black, race-neutral approach to governing signal the end of Black politics, race-based activism and prescriptive policy? In this course, students will use the Obama presidency to think, talk, and write about how race works in America. We'll examine the symbolism of Obama's personal narrative and biracialism to analyze his race-neutral campaigns and governing within the context of history, politics, and policies. We'll look at the public image of Michelle Obama, especially how she is gendered as Black radical and fashionista.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":361533,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"2560","titleShort":"Sociology of Law","titleLong":"Sociology of Law","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17750,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"est45","firstName":"Emily","middleName":"Susann","lastName":"Taylor Poppe"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Malott Hall 253","bldgDescr":"Malott Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MLT253","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course provides an introduction to the sociological perspective of law and legal institutions in modern society.

We will examine the rise of medical sociology as a discipline, the professionalization of medicine, and processes of medicalization and demedicalization. We will look at alternative medical practices and how they differ from and converge with the dominant medical paradigm. We will focus on the rise of medical technology in clinical practice with a special emphases on reproductive technologies. We will focus on the body as a site for medical knowledge, including the medicalization of sex differences, the effect of culture on nutrition, and eating disorders such as obesity and anorexia nervosa.

First, we'll read and discuss previous research on the health effects of social status, patient-physician interactions, employment/work, stress, social networks, social support, loneliness, culture and religion, and the neighborhood context. We'll consider both qualitative and quantitative research on social life and health, with an eye toward identifying the strengths and weaknesses of various methodological approaches and gaps in current knowledge. The second component of this course is focused on the development of your own research regarding the relationship between social context and health. You'll explore this using data from a population-based social survey. Class instruction for this portion of the course will cover research question development, the statistical analysis of survey data, and social scientific writing. Three research reports written during the semester will provide you with a foundation from which you will write and present a final paper that considers how health is shaped by the social world.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":361534,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"3190","titleShort":"Contemporary Soc.

We then review several tools for diagnosing violations of statistical assumptions and what to do when things go wrong, including dealing with outliers, missing data, omitted variables, and weights. Finally, we will explore extensions of the linear regression model, including models for categorical outcomes and hierarchical linear modeling. While statistical modeling is the focus of the course, we proceed with the assumption that models are only as good as the theoretical and substantive knowledge behind them. Thus, in covering the technical material, we will spend considerable time discussing the link between substantive knowledge and statistical practice.

All stages of a research project will be discussed - choice of research topic and appropriate methods; human subject concerns and permissions; issues regarding doing research; as well as the process of writing up and publishing research findings.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":357675,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"6320","titleShort":"Inside Technology","titleLong":"Inside Technology","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16235,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"09:25PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"tjp2","firstName":"Trevor","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Pinch"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 331","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH331","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"STS","catalogNbr":"6321","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Rather than analyze the social impact of technology upon society, this course investigates how society gets inside technology. In other words, is it possible that the very design of technologies embody assumptions about the nature of society? And, if so, are alternative technologies, which embody different assumptions about society, possible? Do engineers have implicit theories about society? Is technology gendered? How can we understand the interaction of society and technology? Throughout the course the arguments are illustrated by detailed examinations of particular technologies, such as the ballistic missile, the bicycle, the electric car, and the refrigerator.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368714,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"6370","titleShort":"Sociology of Sex and Gender","titleLong":"Sociology of Sex and Gender","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18066,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"vm343","firstName":"Vida","middleName":"","lastName":"Maralani"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall G44","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URHG44","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course offers graduate students an introduction to sociological research on sex and gender.

Economic sociology has sought to understand the beliefs, norms, and institutions that shape and drive the global economy. It has sought to extend the sociological approach to the study of economic life by studying the interactions between social structure and economic action. The systematic application of sociological reasoning to explain economic action involves analysis of the ways in which social networks, norms, and institutions matter in economic transactions.

with growing income inequality, with the increasing visibility of inter-country differences in wealth and income, and with the persistence of racial, ethnic, and gender stratification. This course introduces students to ongoing social scientific debates about the sources and consequences of inequality, as well as the types of public policy that might appropriately be pursued to reduce (or increase) inequality. These topics will be addressed in related units, some of which include guest lectures by faculty from other universities (funded by the Center for the Study of Inequality). Each unit culminates with a highly spirited class discussion and

Accordingly, it is co-taught with psychologist Steve Ceci, and is organized around highly controversial \"must-read\" books on diverse topics that expose students to fundamental puzzles about human behavior and social interaction. The readings, combined with guest lectures by the authors, introduce students to disciplinary similarities and differences in the perspectives, theories, concepts, assumptions, and methods used by sociologists (who focus on what happens between individuals) and psychologists (who focus on what happens within). The authors vary from year to year but include Malcolm Gladwell, Michelle Alexander, Nate Silver, and Nicholas Christakis. All authors have agreed to participate in a \"Q&amp;A\" session with the students.

The intent is to provide seniors with an opportunity to summon, integrate, and apply insights that they have acquired over the course of their undergraduate education, and give prospective graduate students the opportunity to lead discussions in a large introductory lecture course, \"Six Pretty Good Books\" (HD/ILRLR/COMM/SOC 2580). Each seminar member is part of a two or three-person team that leads the discussion together, under the supervision of a graduate teaching assistant. Seminar meetings are devoted to building lesson plans for leading an effective discussion of each of the six books. The authors vary from year to year but include Malcolm Gladwell, Michelle Alexander, Nate Silver, and Nicholas Christakis. All authors have agreed to participate in a \"Q&amp;A\" session with the students which seminar members are required to attend.

These \"microsequences\" reflect patterns of movement between contacts and settings. We will discuss recent work in social network analysis, economic sociology, and social psychology on factors that affect the structure of individuals' microsequences. We will also discuss the implications of microsequences for individuals abilities to synchronize and coordinate social action. Finally, we will explore techniques of social microequence analysis. After addressing some important issues regarding data collection, measurement and analysis, students will learn to examine microsequence data.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":354729,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"6910","titleShort":"Independent Study","titleLong":"Independent Study","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":6223,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"rs328","firstName":"Richard","middleName":"","lastName":"Swedberg"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"For graduates who wish to obtain research experience or to do extensive reading on a special topic.
