Hipster Brooklyn. Immigrant Brooklyn. Brownstone Brooklyn. While today Brooklyn is New York City's hippest borough and the site of swift gentrification, booming real estate, and the ever-escalating displacement of immigrant and Black communities, in the 1980s and 1990s it was a hotbed of hip hop music, making the borough synonymous with Black cultural production. New York's most populous borough is still the home of the nation's most concentrated Black population. This course borrows from hip hop's notion of \"representing\" to explore popular and cultural understandings of race and place in Brooklyn as depicted in print, music, and film. How is Brooklyn represented? What do these representations reveal about Black cultural production, inequality and transnational identity formation more broadly speaking? Spanning the period from 1945 to the present day, emphases will include the grassroots movements of the 1960s-1970s, the commodification of hip hop in the 1980s-1990s, and close readings of iconic Brooklyn films such as Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing,\" to reflect on how Black popular culture engages with Brooklyn's many ethnic groups. While materials are interdisciplinary in approach, our investigation is informed by anthropological, historical, and literary texts covering topics including immigration, transnationalism, gentrification, and gendered and racialized inequality.

But how did these images affect the roles that black men and women played on and off the screen and the portrayal of the black body in contemporary society? This interdisciplinary course explores the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in addressing the body in art, film, photography and the media.

This decade marks one of the most turbulent periods in American history and radical changes impacting the political, religious, artistic, legal and educational cultures of Black people occurred during the period. For the most part we take these changes for granted without giving much thought to their origins.

This decade marks one of the most turbulent periods in American history and radical changes impacting the political, religious, artistic, legal and educational cultures of Black people occurred during the period. For the most part we take these changes for granted without giving much thought to their origins. Through a variety of readings, discussions, and research papers, and through the screening of documentaries, the course aims to explore and arrive at a deeper understanding of the major events of the period and to understand how structural issues impacted the lives of African Americans, as well as how they responded to these upheavals.

Beginning with a study of Emerson, we will explore classical and contemporary statements of pragmatism and their political consequences. Among other topics we will discuss action, inquiry, belief, faith, and power.

Lectures, readings, and discussions will examine popular, legal, and political responses to immigration, as reflected in legislation and policy, as well as film, art, literature, and the print media.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":351005,"crseOfferNbr":4,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2000","titleShort":"Introduction to Visual Studies","titleLong":"Introduction to Visual Studies","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":7952,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"cf86","firstName":"Cheryl","middleName":"","lastName":"Finley"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall G64-Kau Aud","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSHG64","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"2000","type":"C"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"2000","type":"C"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"2000","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Provides a broad introduction of modes of vision and the historical impact of visual images, visual structures, and visual space on culture, communication, and politics. The question of \"how we see\" is discussed in terms of (1) procedures of sight (from optical machines to the psychology of vision and the philosophy of aesthetics); (2) spaces of vision (from landscapes to maps to cities); (3) objects of vision (from sacred sites to illuminated books to digital art); and (4) performances of vision (race, sexualities, ethnicities, cultures). Of importance to the course is the practical and conceptual relation of 20th-century visual technologies (photography, cinema, video, and computing) to their historical corollaries in the arts. The course draws on the visual traditions of both Western and non-Western societies and study texts that have defined the premises and analytic vocabularies of the visual. Through viewings, screenings, collaborative writing, and art projects, students develop the critical skills necessary to appreciate how the approaches that define visual studies complicate traditional models of defining and analyzing art objects. Guest lecturers occasionally address the class. Requirements: two objective midterm exams; occasional listserve postings; two five-page papers.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":364259,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2001","titleShort":"The First American University","titleLong":"The First American University","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":7978,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"08:45PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"eeb36","firstName":"Edward","middleName":"Eugene","lastName":"Baptist"},{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"cre8","firstName":"Corey","middleName":"Ryan","lastName":"Earle"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall G01","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URHG01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"2999","type":"C"},{"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"2005","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Educational historian Frederick Rudolph called Cornell University \"the first American university,\" referring to its unique role as a coeducational, nonsectarian, land-grant institution with a broad curriculum and diverse student body.

Environmental history is a quickly evolving field, taking on increasing importance as the environment itself becomes increasingly important in world affairs. During this semester, we'll examine the sometimes unexpected ways in which \"natural\" forces have shaped human history (the role of germs, for instance, in the colonization of North America); the ways in which human beings have shaped the natural world (through agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization, as well as the formation of things like wildlife preserves); and the ways in which cultural, scientific, political, and philosophical attitudes toward the environment have changed over time. This is designed as an intensely interdisciplinary course: we'll view history through the lenses of ecology, literature, art, film, law, anthropology, and geography. Our focus will be on the United States, but, just as environmental pollutants cross borders, so too will this class, especially toward the end, when we attempt to put U.S. environmental history into a geopolitical context. This course is meant to be open to all, including non-majors and first-year students.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":352722,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2600","titleShort":"Intro To American Indian Lits","titleLong":"Introduction to American Indian Literature","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":8852,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"etc7","firstName":"Eric","middleName":"T.","lastName":"Cheyfitz"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Stimson Hall 105","bldgDescr":"Stimson Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STM105","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AIS","catalogNbr":"2600","type":"C"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"2600","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Both oral and written, Native literatures of the U.S. comprise a critical commentary on a range of ongoing issues facing the international community: the environment, sustainability, gender, capitalism, and colonialism.

Under our very noses, however, Native American history has evolved into one of the most exciting, dynamic, and contentious fields of inquiry into America's past. It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to \"unlearn\" about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting. As such, the course will provide numerous opportunities for students to develop their critical thinking and reading skills.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"(HI)","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":352741,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2680","titleShort":"Culture & Politics Of The 60s","titleLong":"Culture and Politics of the 1960s","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15465,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"pls12","firstName":"Paul","middleName":"Lincoln","lastName":"Sawyer"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 142","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH142","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"2680","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Nearly half a century ago, the civil rights movement, the Cold War, and Vietnam stimulated critiques and alternative lifestyles that changed American society forever.

As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective.

In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time. Finally, we will consider how immigrants have negotiated the pressures of their new surroundings, and challenged dominant conceptions of American national identity and citizenship in the process.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":362619,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3131","titleShort":"Nature Functions Limits of Law","titleLong":"The Nature, Functions, and Limits of Law","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17227,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dmc66","firstName":"Dawn","middleName":"Michelle","lastName":"Chutkow"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 184","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH184","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"3131","type":"C"},{"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"4131","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"A general-education course to acquaint students with how our legal system pursues the goals of society.

introduce students to some of the major currents in the history of black radical thought, action and organizing, with an emphasis on the United States after World War I. It relies on social, political and intellectual history to examine the efforts of black people who have sought not merely social reform, but a fundamental restructuring of political, economic and social relations. We will define and evaluate radicalism in the shifting contexts of liberation struggles. We will explore dissenting visions of social organization and alternative definitions of citizenship, progress and freedom. We will confront the meaning of the intersection of race, gender, class and sexuality in social movements.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":352843,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3690","titleShort":"Race and Gender of Poverty","titleLong":"The Race and Gender of Poverty in Literature and Film","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15477,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"etc7","firstName":"Eric","middleName":"T.","lastName":"Cheyfitz"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 236","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH236","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"3690","type":"C"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"3691","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Poverty is an ongoing issue in the United States, and has intensified since the recession of 2008.

The last two decades of the 19th century and the first two of the twentieth marked an abrupt shift in the life experiences of the American people. Daily life changed radically from 1877-1920, as the agrarian republic gave way to an urbanizing consumer society. Debates about \"progress\" characterized the period, as new technologies, new peoples, new forms of politics and culture, and new patterns of living transformed the United States. This course will explore the political, economic, diplomatic and cultural history of the Gilded age and Progressive eras, focusing on the ways American tried to make sense of, to order, to moralize and to shape rapid change.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":363606,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3854","titleShort":"SpTp: Regional Devpt & Globlzn","titleLong":"Special Topics in Regional Development and Globalization","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"080","classNbr":7659,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:00PM","timeEnd":"09:30PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":17,"netid":"ikl1","firstName":"Ian","middleName":"","lastName":"Lekus"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in Washington, DC."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"DC","locationDescr":"Washington, DC","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Social Justice& Urban Issues:Case of Washington,DC"}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"CRP","catalogNbr":"3854","type":"C"},{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"3494","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":350286,"crseOfferNbr":4,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3860","titleShort":"African Am Hist 1910-Present","titleLong":"African American Social History, from 1910 to the Present: Race, Work, and the City","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16641,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"nas4","firstName":"Nick","middleName":"","lastName":"Salvatore"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 108","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS108","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Graded(GRI)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"3860","type":"C"},{"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"3760","type":"C"},{"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"3860","type":"C"},{"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7060","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Examines the experience of black Americans from the start of the Great Migration just before World War I.

In this course, we assess Obama's first term, examining why he accomplished his goals in some areas and not in others. We will also analyze the course that reforms took, and why alternative pathways were not pursued. Our inquiry will immerse us in the study of the institutional arrangements of American politics, the current political context, the challenges and opportunities posed by existing policies, and the legacy of past efforts to address key issues. In the first few weeks of the semester, students will learn about the relationship between the White House and Capitol Hill and the rise of partisan polarization in Congress. The body of the course will focus on prominent issue areas, such as: taxes and inequality, health care, higher education, K-12 education, and the environment. In each case, we will examine the issue in historical perspective by analyzing past reform efforts, and we will consider the Obama administration's record to date and consider the implications for success over the next few years. Students will have the opportunity to write in-depth research papers.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":362162,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4194","titleShort":"American Shakespeare","titleLong":"American Shakespeare","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"080","classNbr":8682,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:00AM","timeEnd":"12:00PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jo267","firstName":"John","middleName":"","lastName":"O'Connor"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in Washington, DC."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"DC","locationDescr":"Washington, DC","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"4291","type":"C"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"4190","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"What is distinctive about American Shakespeare?

This \"Bloodhound Bill\" was designed to make \"slave\" catchers of all Northern whites. Instead it set in motion waves of protests, transformed previously silent whites into underground conductors, further emboldened veteran underground workers and forced thousands of self emancipated Northern blacks to emigrate. The Underground Railroad contributed to convincing Southerners that the Government would not or could not protect slavery. This course examines underground activism beginning in 1850 and offers an interpretation of how the Underground Railroad led to emancipation. The ebbs and flows of underground activity; transnational networks; Civil War military and geo-political issues; and what W.E.B.

How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?Â  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture?

While the first two decisions were perceived as a step back in the fight against racial discrimination, the repeal of DOMA was welcomed by mainstream LGBT-rights organizations as a decisive move towards equality. One of the goals of this seminar is to think these rulings together instead of treating them as separate entities. How did the struggle for sexual rights and the promotion of color blindness come to coexist so easily within the law? In order to understand how liberalism has operated historically and theoretically as a crucial site of regulation for sexuality and race, we will read texts from a wide range of contexts and disciplines including political theory, anthropology, literature, philosophy, history, and law. Readings will include \"classic\" critics of liberalism such as Marx, Nietzsche, Althusser, and Foucault, and contemporary authors such as Wendy Brown, Elizabeth Povinelli, Lisa Duggan, David Eng, Janet Halley, Katherine Franke, and Jasbir Puar, among others.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2594,"crseId":350303,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2020","titleShort":"Pop Cult in US, 1950-Present","titleLong":"Popular Culture in the United States, 1950 to the Present","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1114,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"06/22/2015","endDt":"07/31/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"gca1","firstName":"Glenn","middleName":"C.","lastName":"Altschuler"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Online Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

We will examine the effectiveness of these strategies, as well as related media coverage, popular culture, and public opinion. Readings combine academic sources with film clips, news and policy reports, presidential speeches, memoirs, and journalistic accounts such as Samantha Power's A Problem from Hell. Writing assignments are designed to help students develop strong arguments and the skills necessary for professional writing.

At the conclusion of the course, participants are expected to have a sophisticated understanding of the history of black peoples across the world, the emergence and evolution of the African Diaspora, the place of black people in the American space, the contributions of African-descended peoples and their accomplishments to the constitution of the fabric of American life and thought as well that of various disciplines within the liberal arts.

It helps you to answer these questions: What is capitalism? Is the U.S. more capitalist than other countries? How has capitalism shaped the history of the United States?

The course examines the production and performance of Latina/o identity. We begin by asking the following? How is Latina/o identity defined?Â  How is latinidad performed?Â  We then focus on the politics of ethnic labels and segue into both the Chicana/o and Nuyorican movements as initial sites of Latina/o resistance. We continue by analyzing the immigration of other Latina/o groups such as Cubans and Dominicans, alongside Central and South Americans into the United States, by attending to current issues such as immigration policies and reform. In situating the class around \"Latina/o\" as both an umbrella term and an enacted social construction, we are then able to turn our attention to representations of latinidad within different genres of cultural expressions, such as music and literature alongside critical theory.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367286,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2310","titleShort":"Race and the Zombie Apocalypse","titleLong":"Race and the Zombie Apocalypse","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18898,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"raw324","firstName":"Ricardo","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Wilson"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Stimson Hall 116","bldgDescr":"Stimson Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STM116","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"2310","type":"C"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"2931","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course takes a critical approach to our contemporary understanding of the figure of the zombie and its inextricable link to discourses on race and blackness in the Americas.

This \"Bloodhound Bill\" was designed to make \"slave\" catchers of all Northern whites. Instead it set in motion waves of protests, transformed previously silent whites into underground conductors, further emboldened veteran underground workers and forced thousands of self emancipated Northern blacks to emigrate. The Underground Railroad contributed to convincing Southerners that the Government would not or could not protect slavery. This course examines underground activism beginning in 1850 and offers an interpretation of how the Underground Railroad led to emancipation. The ebbs and flows of underground activity; transnational networks; Civil War military and geo-political issues; and what W.E.B. DuBois called the \"General Strike\" all contributed to making the Thirteenth Amendment a foregone conclusion.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367228,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4412","titleShort":"History & Identity Sports Film","titleLong":"Playing out Difference: History and Identity in Sports Film","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17935,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:35PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sns87","firstName":"Samantha","middleName":"Noelle","lastName":"Sheppard"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts B21","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZB21","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4412","type":"C"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"4412","type":"C"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4412","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The importance of sports to American society and popular culture cannot be denied, and this seminar will study sports films' vital significance in representing the intersection of sports, history, and social identities.Â  This seminar explores how the role of competition between individuals and teams in sports films relate to the competing discourses on race, gender, class, and sexuality in society at large.

What does 21st-century poetry's textual environment look like, and how does it situate itself among other genres, discourses, disciplines, media?

How does contemporary poetry resist, engage, respond to, sound out that noise? How are we to understand its relation to the pivotal cultural, economic, historical, philosophical, political developments of our time? This seminar will explore these and related questions in a wide range of works that open onto the rich interplay of contemporary poetry and poetics with questions of personal and collective identity and language in contexts at once local and global.

Under our very noses, however, Native American history has evolved into one of the most exciting, dynamic, and contentious fields of inquiry into America's past. It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to \"unlearn\" about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting. As such, the course will provide numerous opportunities for students to develop their critical thinking and reading skills.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":365237,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2682","titleShort":"U.S. in 1960s and 1970s","titleLong":"The United States in the 1960s and 1970s","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17293,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:00AM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jkh224","firstName":"Julilly","middleName":"","lastName":"Kohler-Hausmann"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Mcgraw Hall 165","bldgDescr":"McGraw Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MCG165","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"201","classNbr":17294,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 156","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH156","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"202","classNbr":17295,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"McGraw Hall 365","bldgDescr":"McGraw Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MCG365","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"203","classNbr":17556,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"McGraw Hall 366","bldgDescr":"McGraw Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MCG366","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"204","classNbr":17557,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 350","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH350","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC","DIS"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"2680","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This lecture course explores the dramatic cultural, economic, and social upheavals in U.S. society during the 1960s and 1970s.

What is their legacy in politics and in patterns of social interaction? The major movements analyzed are populism; progressivism; labor; socialism; women's suffrage, the contemporary gender equality movement; protest movements of the 1930s; civil rights; SDS and antiwar movements of the 1960s; environmentalism; the 1980s anti-nuclear (weapons) movement; gay rights; and Christian Evangelicals.

This course begins in the late nineteenth century, defining it as a pivotal moment in U.S. immigration and labor history when efforts to regulate immigrant entry and naturalization became increasingly bureaucratized. As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective. We will also address questions regarding the perceived benefit and cost of immigration at both the national and local (i.e., community) levels. In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time. Finally, we will consider how immigrants have negotiated the pressures of their new surroundings, and challenged dominant conceptions of American national identity and citizenship in the process.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":362619,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3131","titleShort":"Nature Functions Limits of Law","titleLong":"The Nature, Functions, and Limits of Law","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17287,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dmc66","firstName":"Dawn","middleName":"Michelle","lastName":"Chutkow"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 184","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH184","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"3131","type":"C"},{"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"4131","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"A general-education course to acquaint students with how our legal system pursues the goals of society.

How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?Â  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture?

with growing income inequality, with the increasing visibility of inter-country differences in wealth and income, and with the persistence of racial, ethnic, and gender stratification. This course introduces students to ongoing social scientific debates about the sources and consequences of inequality, as well as the types of public policy that might appropriately be pursued to reduce (or increase) inequality. These topics will be addressed in related units, some of which include guest lectures by faculty from other universities (funded by the Center for the Study of Inequality).

Our attention will focus on the relationships and contexts from which particular Native American literatures emerge, and ethical considerations associated with entering Indigenous territory, both figuratively and literally. In response to a selection of traditional stories, fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and a graphic novel or two, we will examine how Native literatures voice scathing critiques of settler-colonial values and practices, and yet challenge, delight, and intrigue their readers.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":366403,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2615","titleShort":"Orange is the New Black","titleLong":"Orange is the New Black","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":10069,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"cjw279","firstName":"Christopher","middleName":"James","lastName":"Wildeman"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall G73","bldgDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MVRG73","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"PAM","catalogNbr":"2610","type":"C"},{"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"2610","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"In a 2015 speech, President Barack Obama described the the American criminal justice system as hopefully broken, with prison conditions so abominable that they had no place in the civilized world.

Through readings, discussions, lectures, films, a guest presentation, group work, and other course assignments, we'll consider Indigenous North American knowledge systems and worldviews with a particular eye toward how these ideas are related to geographic space, social structure, culture, science, and contemporary global problems.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":352843,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3690","titleShort":"Race and Gender of Poverty","titleLong":"The Race and Gender of Poverty in Literature and Film","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16369,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"etc7","firstName":"Eric","middleName":"T.","lastName":"Cheyfitz"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 158","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH158","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"3690","type":"C"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"3691","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Poverty is an ongoing issue in the United States, and has intensified since the recession of 2008.

The course will have a lecture/discussion format; student participation is highly valued and encouraged. The last two decades of the 19th century and the first two of the twentieth marked an abrupt shift in the life experiences of the American people. Daily life changed radically from 1877-1920, as the agrarian republic gave way to an urbanizing consumer society. Debates about \"progress\" characterized the period, as new technologies, new peoples, new forms of politics and culture, and new patterns of living transformed the United States. This course will explore the political, economic, diplomatic and cultural history of the Gilded age and Progressive eras, focusing on the ways American tried to make sense of, to order, to moralize and to shape rapid change.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":367227,"crseOfferNbr":5,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3754","titleShort":"Spoken Word, Hip-Hop Theater","titleLong":"Spoken Word, Hip-Hop Theater, and the Politics of the Performance","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":9927,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"kj12","firstName":"Karen","middleName":"","lastName":"Jaime"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts 124","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZ124","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"3954","type":"C"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"3754","type":"C"},{"subject":"LGBT","catalogNbr":"3754","type":"C"},{"subject":"LSP","catalogNbr":"3754","type":"C"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"3754","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"In this course, we will critically examine the production and performance of race, ethnicity, sexuality, and gender through literature and contemporary performance genres such as spoken word, slam poetry, and hip-hop theatre.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":368003,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3785","titleShort":"Civil Disobedience","titleLong":"Civil Disobedience","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16455,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"pal229","firstName":"Alexander","middleName":"","lastName":"Livingston"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"White Hall 104","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT104","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"3785","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course will expose students to the theory and practice of civil disobedience in historical and contemporary perspectives.

Today, some of the most heated debates surrounding feminism, identity politics, and Black women are framed within the broad contours of hip hop. This course will explore how women are portrayed in hip hop music and culture, addressing women both as consumers and producers. We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and peripheral female artists use hip hop to affirm their sexual power, articulate Black feminism, and create spaces for their artistic expression. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, performance studies, and queer of color critique to complicate the ways in which women, gender, and sexuality are represented in hip hop music. While our analyses will center on music and on the United States, we will also consider art, fashion, and dance within Black, Latina, and Caribbean interactions with hip hop. The course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-Ã -vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about Black women's conceptualizations of feminism? How can we apply early \"hip hop feminism\" to understand current debates about BeyoncÃ© and Nicki Minaj?Â  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? What are the relationships between queer theory and hip hop studies? Does hip hop allow spaces for alternative femininities? How do Black girls use hip hop as a pedagogical tool? The course will also address broader questions related to representations of Black femininity, people of color in the media, gender and sexual identity construction.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":368055,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4645","titleShort":"Walden and Beyond","titleLong":"Walden and Beyond","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16495,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jpw246","firstName":"James","middleName":"Perrin","lastName":"Warren"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Olin Library 303","bldgDescr":"Olin Library","facilityDescrshort":"OLL303","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"4655","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"An intensive study of Henry David Thoreau's Walden, accompanied by readings in Thoreau's \"Civil Disobedience,\" his deathbed collection The Maine Woods, and his late natural history essays.

Black girls are hypervisible, both as \"at risk\" and as cultural trendsetters, and simultaneously rendered invisible in public policy discourses. Yet, Black girls' social worlds reveal entrenched racialized and gendered inequalities, and form the basis for some of the most innovative work in the social sciences and the humanities. We will consider Black girlhood studies that fall within the ethnographic tradition, including Elizabeth Chin's Purchasing Power: Black Kids and American Consumer Culture (2001), Oneka LaBennett's She's Mad Real: Popular Culture and West Indian Girls in Brooklyn (2011), and Aimee Meredith Cox's Shapeshifters: Black Girls and the Choreography of Citizenship (2015), using these texts to examine Black girls' complex racialized, gendered, and age-based cultural realities. The course will also explore the transition from girlhood to womanhood, while surveying the borders of interdisciplinarity and what constitutes Black girlhood ethnography by considering historical approaches, films, and ethnographic novels. Other works covered will include Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), Paule Marshall's Brown Girl, Brownstones (1959), and Octavia Butler's Fledgling (2005).Â  While our primary focus will be on Black girlhood in the U.S. and the Caribbean, broader diasporic treatments such as CÃ©line Sciamma's Girlhood/Bande de Filles (2014) will frame black girlhood in global contexts.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":366439,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"6606","titleShort":"The Politics of Pragmatism","titleLong":"The Politics of Pragmatism","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15906,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:30PM","timeEnd":"06:30PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"pal229","firstName":"Alexander","middleName":"","lastName":"Livingston"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"White Hall 114","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT114","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"6606","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar will examine the political consequences of American pragmatism.

Environmental history is a quickly evolving field, taking on increasing importance as the environment itself becomes increasingly important in world affairs. During this semester, we'll examine the sometimes unexpected ways in which \"natural\" forces have shaped human history (the role of germs, for instance, in the colonization of North America); the ways in which human beings have shaped the natural world (through agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization, as well as the formation of things like wildlife preserves); and the ways in which cultural, scientific, political, and philosophical attitudes toward the environment have changed over time. This is designed as an intensely interdisciplinary course: we'll view history through the lenses of ecology, literature, art, film, law, anthropology, and geography. Our focus will be on the United States, but, just as environmental pollutants cross borders, so too will this class, especially toward the end, when we attempt to put U.S. environmental history into a geopolitical context.

Hipster Brooklyn. Immigrant Brooklyn. Brownstone Brooklyn. This course borrows from hip hop's notion of \"representing\" to explore popular and cultural understandings of race and place in Brooklyn as depicted in print, music, film, and online. How is Brooklyn represented? Who represents Brooklyn? What do these representations reveal about Black cultural production, inequality, and identity formation more broadly speaking? While today Brooklyn is New York City's hippest borough and the site of swift gentrification, booming real estate, and the ever-escalating displacement of immigrant and Black communities, in the 1980s and 1990s it was a hotbed of hip hop music, making the borough synonymous with Black cultural production. Now a \"global brand,\" New York's most populous borough is still the home of the nation's most concentrated Black population. The course examines Black cultural production as it relates to representations of Brooklyn. It also deconstructs images and discourses that marginalize the borough's Black residents. Spanning the period from 1945 to the present day, emphases will include the grassroots movements of the 1960s-1970s, the commodification of hip hop in the 1980s-1990s, and close readings of films including Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing,\" to reflect on how Black popular culture engages with Brooklyn's diverse communities. While materials are interdisciplinary in approach, our investigation is informed by anthropological, historical, and literary texts covering topics including immigration, youth culture, transnationalism, gentrification, authenticity, and classed, gendered and racialized inequality.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":365298,"crseOfferNbr":4,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3065","titleShort":"Immigrant America","titleLong":"Immigrant America: Race and Citizenship in Modern Working-Class History","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":8724,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"vm248","firstName":"Veronica","middleName":"","lastName":"Martinez-Matsuda"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 217","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS217","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"3065","type":"C"},{"subject":"LATA","catalogNbr":"3065","type":"C"},{"subject":"LSP","catalogNbr":"3065","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Immigration discourse and policy has played a central role in shaping the modern American nation-state, including its composition, values, and institutions. This course begins in the late nineteenth century, defining it as a pivotal moment in U.S. immigration and labor history when efforts to regulate immigrant entry and naturalization became increasingly bureaucratized. As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective. We will also address questions regarding the perceived benefit and cost of immigration at both the national and local (i.e., community) levels. In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time. Finally, we will consider how immigrants have negotiated the pressures of their new surroundings, and challenged dominant conceptions of American national identity and citizenship in the process.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":362619,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3131","titleShort":"Nature Functions Limits of Law","titleLong":"The Nature, Functions, and Limits of Law","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16151,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dmc66","firstName":"Dawn","middleName":"Michelle","lastName":"Chutkow"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 184","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH184","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"3131","type":"C"},{"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"4131","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"A general-education course to acquaint students with how our legal system pursues the goals of society.

How was space reordered and governed? What methods were used to mobilize labor? How did global connections shape inequality between and within societies, producing extraordinary prosperity alongside poverty, famine, and war?

Affair, Spartacus, The Ten Commandments, Reds, Schindler's List, Apocalypse Now, Argo, Black Hawk Down, JFK and Selma.Â  Films will be available on Blackboard through streaming.Â  We will spend approximately two weeks on each film, reading historical essays on the period depicted as well as film and cultural analysis.Â  Classes will combine lecture format for historical framing and context

The course examines the production and performance of Latina/o identity. We begin by asking the following? How is Latina/o identity defined?Â  How is latinidad performed?Â  We then focus on the politics of ethnic labels and segue into both the Chicana/o and Nuyorican movements as initial sites of Latina/o resistance. We continue by analyzing the immigration of other Latina/o groups such as Cubans and Dominicans, alongside Central and South Americans into the United States, by attending to current issues such as immigration policies and reform. In situating the class around \"Latina/o\" as both an umbrella term and an enacted social construction, we are then able to turn our attention to representations of latinidad within different genres of cultural expressions, such as music and literature alongside critical

with growing income inequality, with the increasing visibility of inter-country differences in wealth and income, and with the persistence of racial, ethnic, and gender stratification. This course introduces students to ongoing social scientific debates about the sources and consequences of inequality, as well as the types of public policy that might appropriately be pursued to reduce (or increase) inequality. These topics will be addressed in related units, some of which include guest lectures by faculty from other universities (funded by the Center for the Study of Inequality).

We will review important archaeological sites such as Chaco Canyon, Cahokia, Lamoka Lake, and the Little Bighorn battlefield. A principal focus will be on major transformations in lifeways such as the adoption of agriculture, the development of political-economic hierarchies, and the disruptions that accompanied the arrival of Europeans to the continent.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":352722,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2600","titleShort":"Intro To Native American Lits","titleLong":"Introduction to Native American Literature","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":9465,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"cew254","firstName":"Carol","middleName":"Edelman","lastName":"Warrior"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AIIS","catalogNbr":"2600","type":"C"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"2600","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The production of North American Indigenous literatures began long before European colonization, and persists in a variety of printed, sung, carved, painted, written, spoken, and digital media.

Our attention will focus on the relationships and contexts from which particular Native American literatures emerge, and ethical considerations associated with entering Indigenous territory, both figuratively and literally.

On the edge literally and metaphorically, these cities seem to be about competing visions of urban form, culture, and modernity. And the iconic forms of New York (tenements and skyscrapers) and of Los Angeles (highways and suburban homes) have fascinated film makers from the 19th century to the present day. We will both evoke and complicate the contrast between New York and Los Angeles by mapping the intersections of each city with cinema. We explore how the urban experience has been said to give rise to particular cinematic forms and the ways in which cinematic styles may be translated into urban design. Topics may include density and sprawl; place and creativity; class and ethnicity; race and gender; culture and commercialism; industrial and media economies; and insularism and cosmopolitanism. Screenings will include documentary, experimental, and commercial films and cover such genres as early actualities, city symphonies, film noir, science fiction, etc. Readings will be drawn from theories and histories of film, urbanism, and architecture.

This \"Bloodhound Bill\" was designed to make \"slave\" catchers of all Northern whites. Instead it set in motion waves of protests, transformed previously silent whites into underground conductors, further emboldened veteran underground workers and forced thousands of self emancipated Northern blacks to emigrate. The Underground Railroad contributed to convincing Southerners that the Government would not or could not protect slavery. This course examines underground activism beginning in 1850 and offers an interpretation of how the Underground Railroad led to emancipation. The ebbs and flows of underground activity; transnational networks; Civil War military and geo-political issues; and what W.E.B. DuBois called the \"General Strike\" all contributed to making the Thirteenth Amendment a foregone conclusion.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":369012,"crseOfferNbr":5,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4587","titleShort":"American

This course looks at the differing structural positions of Jews (the \"other within\" Christian Europe) and Native Americans (the \"other without\").

In 2015 Cornell University acquired a substantial archive of Velvet Underground material, including rare photographs, posters, flyers, handwritten lyrics, rare recordings, and ephemera.Â  The first segment of this course will delve into music, lyrics, and the performance art of the Velvet Underground as an archive of underground and dissident art and identities in New York City; the second segment of the course will be devoted to working with the Cornell Velvet Underground Archive to develop student projects.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":367270,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"6596","titleShort":"Theories of Non/Violence","titleLong":"Theories of Non/Violence","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15964,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:30PM","timeEnd":"06:30PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"pal229","firstName":"Alexander","middleName":"","lastName":"Livingston"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"6596","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course will examine the theory and practice of nonviolence from the perspective of its key theorists, practitioners, and critics.

Particular case studies will be addressed stemming from the faculty's specializations (for example, Vietnam, Cambodia, Guatemala, and Chile) and the emphasis is on the role of the United States in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Prominent themes will include forms of subversion, from military muscle to economic coercion, and how and why they have changed over time; meanings of liberty, democracy, freedom, and sovereignty in different places and times; popular responses to policies and actions of foreign administrations; the relationships between sovereign states and transnational corporations; the uses and abuses of

This is designed as an intensely interdisciplinary course: we'll view history through the lenses of ecology, literature, art, film, law, anthropology, and geography. Our focus will be on the United States, but, just as environmental pollutants cross borders, so too will this class, especially toward the end, when we attempt to put U.S. environmental history into a geopolitical context.

Under our very noses, however, Native American history has evolved into one of the most exciting, dynamic, and contentious fields of inquiry into America's past. It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to \"unlearn\" about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting. As such, the course will provide numerous opportunities for students to develop their critical thinking and reading skills.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":352741,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2680","titleShort":"Culture & Politics Of The 60s","titleLong":"Culture and Politics of the 1960s","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15551,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"pls12","firstName":"Paul","middleName":"Lincoln","lastName":"Sawyer"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"2680","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Fifty years ago, American society exploded; but 1968 was only a moment in the decade when the civil rights movement, the counter culture, and the Vietnam war stimulated alternative lifestyles and powerful dissents that changed the world forever.

We will consider the roles played by both institutions (congress, the bureaucracy and interests groups) and everyday people. Finally, we will closely study several specific policy arenas (a few likely candidates include: education policy, health policy, social welfare policy and housing policy).

journeyed on from her days as a student here to become one of the world's greatest writers, how she has helped to transform world literature, andÂ  how she hasÂ  shapedÂ  Cornell's great legacy.Â  In this course, we will engage in close and reflective critical readings of Toni Morrison's eleven novels.Â  Morrison's writing style is characterized by highly distinctive strategies in the development of narrative and in the use of language.Â  Furthermore, from novel to novel, she is even known for developing features such as the very first sentence with great contemplation, an approach that also demonstrates her commitment to form.Â  As we journey across her body of work as readers, we will examine a range of recurring themes, along with the \"love trilogy\" on which she focused her repertoire for several years.Â  The course, through a comprehensive, chronological and focused look at Morrison's body of novels, will help students who entirely lack familiarity with it to gain a strong foundation for further research and study.Â  By the end of the course, even students who already know Morrison's work will walk away with a deeper and more nuanced critical understanding of it.Â  The course will help students to reinforce their skills in reading fiction, and help them to become more astute and exacting readers of the novel as a genre.Â  Morrison's novels have placed her at the vanguard of the globalization of the novel itself, and she is, undisputedly, one the most famous and innovative writers in the world.Â  She emerged as one of the greatest and most prolific writers of the twentieth century, and her audiences have continued to be captivated by her literary genius in this millennial age.Â  She is one of the most revered writers within the American literary establishment and has helped to reshape it both as a critic and novelist.Â  Her work can help one to develop more mastery in reading the novel as a genre.Â  Indeed, her thinking about this area is so original and pivotal that her fiction and critical works are absolutely indispensable for all serious students and scholars in fields such as American literature.Â  Its impact on African American literature is equally vital.Â  We will focus on reading the repertoire of novels by Morrison, including The Bluest Eye, Sula (1973), Song of Solomon (1977), Tar Baby (1981), Beloved (1987), Jazz (1992), Paradise (1998), Love (2003),Â  A Mercy (2008) Home (2012), and God Bless the Child (2014).Â  We will screen the 1998 film adaptation of her novel Beloved, along with documentaries related to Morrison such as Gail Pellet and Bill Moyers's Toni Morrison:Â  A Writer's Work and Gary Deans, Alan Hall and Jana Wendt's Toni Morrison: Uncensored.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":369284,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4619","titleShort":"Writing

How can we read poster art and murals as texts or narratives? How does poetry perform or visualize a collective movement and political moment? By centering our study on these questions, we will move through the poster art, murals, and poems of Chicanos/as, U.S. Latinos/as, and African Americans during the 1960s and 1970s.

Answering these questions immerses us in the study of American political development to assess the evolution, character, and scope of the administrative state and of other arrangements-typically channeled through the private sector-through which the nation implements public policies. In the processes, the course grapples with analytical questions about processes of political change and considers a variety of theoretical approaches. Variants of \"new institutionalism\" will be highlighted, as well as reflections on the puzzles of American exceptionalism. The body of the course will investigate such topics as the development of public bureaucracy, the emergence of the civil service, and the evolution of the regulatory state and the welfare state.

with growing income inequality, with the increasing visibility of inter-country differences in wealth and income, and with the persistence of racial, ethnic, and gender stratification. This course introduces students to ongoing social scientific debates about the sources and consequences of inequality, as well as the types of public policy that might appropriately be pursued to reduce (or increase) inequality. These topics will be addressed in related units, some of which include guest lectures by faculty from other universities (funded by the Center for the Study of Inequality). Each unit culminates with a highly spirited class discussion and debate.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-SBY)","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA18"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":366679,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2251","titleShort":"U.S. Immigration Narratives","titleLong":"U.S. Immigration Narratives","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16354,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mcg20","firstName":"Maria Cristina","middleName":"","lastName":"Garcia"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"2251","type":"C"},{"subject":"LSP","catalogNbr":"2251","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2018","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Americans are conflicted about immigration.Â  We honor and celebrate (and commercialize) our immigrant heritage in museums, folklife festivals, parades, pageants, and historical monuments. We also build fences and detention centers, and pass more and more laws to bar access to the United States. Polls tell us that Americans are concerned about the capacity of the United States to absorb so many immigrants from around the world. How often have we heard the laments \"Today's immigrants are too different. They don't want to assimilate\" or \"My grandparents learned English quickly, why can't they?\" The assumption is that older generations 'Americanized' quickly but that today's immigrants do not want to assimilate. Did 19th century immigrants really migrate to the United States to \"become Americans\"? Did they really assimilate quickly? Are today's immigrants really all that different from the immigrants who arrived earlier? Why do these particular narratives have such power and currency?

The idea was to trigger an apocalyptic race war he called \"Helter Skelter\" (after a song by The Beatles). Today, these murders stand as the most infamous in twentieth-century U.S. criminal history and as synecdoche for the \"end of the Sixties.\" They have also spawned a veritable Manson Industry in the popular realm: there are now Manson books, movies, TV shows, documentaries, podcasts, websites, music, comics, t-shirts, and even a tourist attraction (the Hollywood \"Helter Skelter\" tour).Â  The seminar will analyze the history of the Manson murders as well as their incredible resonance in American culture over the past half century. Who was Charles Manson and who were the members of the Family? What was the Family's relation to the counterculture, to Hollywood, Vietnam, the Black Panther Party, and environmentalism? How might we fit the Manson murders into the long history of apocalyptic violence and terror? And what does it mean that the Manson murders have occupied our collective imagination for fifty years? To answer these and other questions, we will analyze a variety of sources including television and newspaper reports, trial transcripts, true crime writing, memoirs, interviews, novels, films and documentaries, podcasts and pop songs.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA18"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":357763,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2350","titleShort":"Arkeo of North American Indian","titleLong":"Archaeology of North American Indians","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":9110,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"kj21","firstName":"Kurt","middleName":"Anders","lastName":"Jordan"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AIIS","catalogNbr":"2350","type":"C"},{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"2235","type":"C"},{"subject":"ARKEO","catalogNbr":"2235","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2018","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This introductory course surveys archaeology's contributions to the study of American Indian cultural diversity and change in North America north of Mexico.

We will consider the rise of Hollywood in the age of mass production; the star system; the introduction of sound and the function of the soundtrack; Hollywood's rivalry with television; censorship; the rise of independent film, etc. Weekly screenings introduce major American genres (e.g. science fiction, film noir, the musical) and directors (e.g. Hitchcock, Kubrick, Tarantino).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Each student must enroll in a section and attend one screening per week.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA18"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":359270,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"2770","titleShort":"Representing Racial Encounters","titleLong":"Representing Racial Encounters/Encountering Racial Representations","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":9381,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"emd233","firstName":"Ella","middleName":"Maria","lastName":"Diaz"},{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"mwn39","firstName":"Mukoma","middleName":"Wa","lastName":"Ngugi"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"2770","type":"C"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"2770","type":"C"},{"subject":"LSP","catalogNbr":"2770","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2018","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This team-taught course uses literature and popular culture, alongside literary, social, and cultural theory to consider how people from different cultures encounter and experience each other.

In the second half of the course, we will investigate a number of contemporary facets of urban inequality in-depth, such as residential segregation, urban schooling, immigration, and suburban sprawl.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-SBY)","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 20 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA18"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":368855,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3463","titleShort":"Contemporary Television","titleLong":"Contemporary Television","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":9653,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:35PM","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sns87","firstName":"Samantha","middleName":"Noelle","lastName":"Sheppard"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"3463","type":"C"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"3463","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2018","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course considers issues, approaches, and complexities in the contemporary television landscape.

Never before or since have so many African American performers been featured in starring roles. Macho male images were projected alongside strong, yet sexually submissive female ones. But how did these images affect the roles that black men and women played on and off the screen and the portrayal of the black body in contemporary society? This interdisciplinary course explores the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in addressing the body in art, film, photography and the media. We will consider how the display of the black body affects how we see and interpret the world by examining the construction of beauty, fashion, hairstyles and gendered images as well as sexuality, violence, race, and hip-hop culture.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA18"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":365706,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3562","titleShort":"Indigenous Philosophies","titleLong":"Thinking from a Different Place: Indigenous Philosophies","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":8640,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"cew254","firstName":"Carol","middleName":"Edelman","lastName":"Warrior"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AIIS","catalogNbr":"3560","type":"C"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"3560","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2018","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The Western nation-state has failed to solve the two most pressing, indeed catastrophic, global problems: poverty and climate change.

A significant portion of the class focuses on debates about U.S. democracy in the decades after the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Rabinor Seminar.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA18"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":357776,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4272","titleShort":"Archaeology of Colonialism","titleLong":"Archaeology of Colonialism and Cultural Entanglement","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16457,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"kj21","firstName":"Kurt","middleName":"Anders","lastName":"Jordan"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AIIS","catalogNbr":"4720","type":"B"},{"subject":"AIIS","catalogNbr":"7720","type":"B"},{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"6272","type":"B"},{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"4272","type":"B"},{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"7272","type":"B"},{"subject":"ARKEO","catalogNbr":"4272","type":"B"},{"subject":"ARKEO","catalogNbr":"7272","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2018","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar uses archaeology to examine engagements between settlers and indigenous peoples throughout world history.

We will examine the strengths and weaknesses of the history of capitalism approach to analyzing and understanding American history.
