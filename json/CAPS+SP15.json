transformations.  In surveying this history from the seventeenth century to the present, this course aims to provide an understanding of the changes, continuities, and contingencies in the making of modern China.  Topics will include the formation and fall of imperial power under the Qing Dynasty, the challenges of building a nation under the Republic, and the patterns and contradictions of social revolution under state socialism.  Attention will also be given to issues of economy, environment, ethnicity, gender, and the politics of history.  This course is open to all students and assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese culture, history, or language.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":359184,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"CAPS","catalogNbr":"4020","titleShort":"Honors

Studies from broader theoretical perspectives, to engage in academic discourse and policy debate about implications of China rising, to reflect on their four-year learning experience in Ithaca, Washington, D.C., and Beijing as students of contemporary China studies, and to enhance their abilities to pursue future studies and/or careers that are related to their CAPS experience after graduating from Cornell.  The seminar is organized around the central theme - China rising - and roughly divided into three sections:  (1) China's rise and the \"paradigm change\" in world politics; (2) China's quest for identity and order; and (3) implications of China rising for the U.S. and the world.  Under each of these sections, a few specific topics are identified for class discussion.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":362734,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"CAPS","catalogNbr":"4999","titleShort":"CAPS
