Through case studies of familial and conjugal love in Africa, Asia, the US, Europe, and South and Latin America, the course will examine the debates about and enactment's of what constitutes the appropriate way to show love and affection in different cultures and historical contexts. Among the themes we will explore are questions of sexuality, marriage, kinship, and gender rights. A final unit will examine these themes through modern technologies such as the Internet, scientific advances in medicine, and a growing awareness that who and how we love is anything but simple or universal.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":354735,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"2010","titleShort":"Intro To FGSS","titleLong":"Introduction to Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":6226,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"mkm23","firstName":"Kate","middleName":"","lastName":"McCullough"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Feminist, Gender, &amp; Sexuality Studies is an interdisciplinary program focused on understanding the impact of gender and sexuality on the world around us and on the power hierarchies that structure it.

Students will be introduced to a wide array of literature produced in Western Europe and elsewhere pertaining to the Middle Eastern societies and cultures for a critical analysis of how knowledge and discourses about gender roles had been constructed in the course of the nineteenth century. In addition, students will learn about the ways in which Islamic law and legal institutions defined and managed the issues in relation to women's status as well as sexuality and marriage as social institutions. We will investigate how historical and contemporary political and social forces such as nationalism, colonialism, and revolutions operated in the course of the twentieth century, shaping both women's movement and advocating for women's rights before the law, access to education and family issues. Finally, this course will introduce students to the debates on \"gender as a useful category\" by connecting it to the recent and growing scholarship on masculinity and queer studies in the Middle East. By doing so, we will analyze relationality of women, men, and transgender categories and their political and social implications in the past and the present.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":354744,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"3000","titleShort":"Feminist Theory","titleLong":"Feminist Theory","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":9754,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ler35","firstName":"Lucinda","middleName":"E.G.","lastName":"Ramberg"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Prerequisite: FGSS 2010: Intro to Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course will work across and between the disciplines to consider what it might mean to think 'as a feminist' about many things including, but not limited to 'gender', 'women' and 'sexuality'.

Moreover, these depictions may be different from what people experience in their everyday lives.  In the contemporary theatre, we have the opportunity to consider representations of individuals' lived religion, the complex questions of belief, and challenges to faith from within and outside religious communities.  Through close readings of plays and related materials engaging with Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and other faith traditions, we will explore and discuss together the religious motivations, tensions, and dilemmas facing us today.  Our texts include, among others, Jesus Christ

present.  The focus is on China and Japan, with secondary attention to South Asia and Korea.  Interaction with the West is a major theme.  Topics include disease control, birth control and population control, the history of masculinity, the science of sex, normative and stigmatized sexualities, honorific violence, body modification, fashion, disability, and eugenics.  We first explore the body in \"traditional\" Asian cultures, legal regimes, and medical practice.  We then explore the modernization of sex, health, and the body itself under the major rival political movements in Asia: imperialism, nationalism, communism, and feminism.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":367328,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4153","titleShort":"Topics

From their association with Andy Warhol beginning in 1965, to their last recorded performance with Lou Reed in August 1970, the Velvet Underground revitalized rock 'n' roll as streetwise outsider art.  Lyrics tell of hard drugs, hustlers, and queer and transgender lives, while the music ranges from noise, drones, feedback, and minimalism to edgy pop tunes. In 2015 Cornell University acquired a substantial archive of Velvet Underground material, including rare photographs, posters, flyers, handwritten lyrics, rare recordings, and ephemera.  The first segment of this course will delve into music, lyrics, and the performance art of the Velvet Underground as an archive of underground and dissident art and identities in New York City; the second segment of the course will be devoted to working with the Cornell Velvet Underground Archive to develop student projects.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":368897,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4458","titleShort":"Women and Girls in Education","titleLong":"Women, Girls and Gender in Education","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16328,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sav33","firstName":"Sofia","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Villenas"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"4458","type":"W"},{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"7458","type":"W"},{"subject":"EDUC","catalogNbr":"4458","type":"W"},{"subject":"EDUC","catalogNbr":"7458","type":"W"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"7458","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar explores and compares the educational and schooling experiences of young women and girls through an array of ethnographic studies conducted in different regions of the world.

Second, we inquire into how gendered notions of development and state sanctioned forms of structural and symbolic violence, impact young women's educational experiences and opportunities, and how they in turn respond.

It pays special attention to the ways in which sexuality and gendered embodiment are at present linked to citizenship and other forms of belonging and to how the films draw on Buddhist and Islamic traditions of representation and belief. Focusing on globally circulating Southeast Asian films of the past 15 years, the course draws on current writings from feminism, Buddhist studies, affect theory, queer studies, postcolonial theory, and film studies to ask what new understandings of subjectivity might emerge from these cinemas and their political contexts. Films will be drawn from both mainstream and independent cinema and will include the work of directors such as Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Danny and Oxide Pang, Yau Ching, Thunska Pansittivorakul, Garin Nugroho, and Jean-Jacques Annaud.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":368840,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"6333","titleShort":"The Velvet Underground Archive","titleLong":"The Velvet Underground Archive","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16186,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jap28","firstName":"Judith","middleName":"Ann","lastName":"Peraino"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Lincoln Hall 316","bldgDescr":"Lincoln Hall","facilityDescrshort":"LNC316","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4331","type":"B"},{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"6331","type":"B"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4333","type":"B"},{"subject":"LGBT","catalogNbr":"4331","type":"B"},{"subject":"LGBT","catalogNbr":"6332","type":"B"},{"subject":"MUSIC","catalogNbr":"4331","type":"B"},{"subject":"MUSIC","catalogNbr":"6331","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The Velvet Underground remains one of the most acclaimed and influential rock groups to emerge within the culturally turbulent era of the late 1960s. From their association with Andy Warhol beginning in 1965, to their last recorded performance with Lou Reed in August 1970, the Velvet Underground revitalized rock 'n' roll as streetwise outsider art.  Lyrics tell of hard drugs, hustlers, and queer and transgender lives, while the music ranges from noise, drones, feedback, and minimalism to edgy pop tunes. In 2015 Cornell University acquired a substantial archive of Velvet Underground material, including rare photographs, posters, flyers, handwritten lyrics, rare recordings, and ephemera.  The first segment of this course will delve into music, lyrics, and the performance art of the Velvet Underground as an archive of underground and dissident art and identities in New York City; the second segment of the course will be devoted to working with the Cornell Velvet Underground Archive to develop student projects.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":355400,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"6580","titleShort":"Race & Gender-Asian Hist & Lit","titleLong":"Theorizing Gender and Race in Asian Histories and Literatures","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16062,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ns32","firstName":"Naoki","middleName":"","lastName":"Sakai"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"6688","type":"C"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6680","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"For a long time area studies have overlooked the over-determined links of gender, race/ethnicity, and social class in fields related to East Asia and the trans-Pacific regions.

This course is designed to offer a series of discussions about the following problems: (1) the historically specific modes of sexism and racism in social spaces related to Japan and other places in the trans-Pacific; (2) the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and social class in various contexts including those of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism; (3) the roles of gender, race, and social class in the United States' knowledge production about East Asia in general; and (4) the conceptions of gender and race in the social formations particular to East Asia.

Drawing on the fields of anthropology of education and feminist studies, we examine how girls and young women construct gender identities and ways of knowing through prisms of race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, language, nation and citizenship. Second, we inquire into how gendered notions of development and state sanctioned forms of structural and symbolic violence, impact young women's educational experiences and opportunities, and how they in turn respond. Lastly, we consider young women as learners who craft their own lives and literacies across borders and diverse spaces of home, school, community, and peer group.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":369013,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"7587","titleShort":"American Jewish Women","titleLong":"American Jewish Women and the Body of Tradition","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17344,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"09:25PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"4587","type":"B"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4587","type":"B"},{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"4587","type":"B"},{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"7587","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"4587","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"7587","type":"B"},{"subject":"RELST","catalogNbr":"4587","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":null,"catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"}]
