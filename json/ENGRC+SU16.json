A student doing a directed study works one-on-one with an ECP instructor to pursue an aspect of professional communications in more depth than is possible in the ECP's regular courses. Various types of projects are possible, e.g., studying forms of technical documentation, creating user manuals, analyzing and producing technical visuals, reading and writing about problems in engineering performance, and communicating about technical topics for the public.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"EN"},{"strm":2629,"crseId":355624,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ENGRC","catalogNbr":"3350","titleShort":"Comm for Engineering Managers","titleLong":"Communications for Engineering Managers","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"201","classNbr":1774,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"07/18/2016","endDt":"08/05/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"gg67","firstName":"Gerald","middleName":"D.","lastName":"Gabriel"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"07/18/2016","endDt":"08/05/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"DW","instrModeDescrshort":"DL WWW","instrModeDescr":"Distance Learning - WWW","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["DIS"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"SP2","sessionBeginDt":"06/01/2016","sessionEndDt":"08/05/2016","sessionLong":"Summer Special Session 2"}],"description":"ENGRC 3500 in that students write various types of documents (e.g., letters, memos, executive summaries, progress reports), give talks, and incorporate graphics in both their oral and written work.
