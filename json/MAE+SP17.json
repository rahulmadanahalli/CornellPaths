Students will learn how real-world problems can be solved using models, algorithms, and statistical tools. The course is organized around a set of team-based scientific computing projects drawn from various engineering and life science fields, using actual research and/or industrial computational codes. Leveraging simplified and user-friendly software interfaces and tutorials, the course focuses on the inductive learning of key concepts and topics such as physical and computational model formulation, verification and validation, uncertainty analysis, post-processing and data mining, and a high-level introduction to high performance computing. The course culminates with a community-engaged project, in which students are introduced to the basics of engineering design and team management to develop and animate a scientific computing activity in collaboration with, and tailored for, the Sciencenter.  Future Science Leaders program for middle- and high-schoolers. No prior programming experience is necessary, and a high-school math level is assumed.

In addition to the biological and medical aspects of cancer, engineering/chemistry/physics aspects of the process e.g., transport, reaction rates, tumor growth models will be discussed at a quantitative level when relevant to system-level understanding of cancer. Topics: Nature and hallmarks of cancer. Introductory human cell biology and modes of dysregulation by carcinogenesis. Cell cycle, aberrant mitogens, dysregulation of checkpoints. Framework and notation for describing reaction networks. Genetic foundations of cancer phenotype--germline and somatic. Tumorigenesis and metastasis. Clinical staging and medical management of the most common human cancers, including breast, prostate, lung, pancreas, colon, leukemia, lymphoma.
