Taxes have a direct impact on cash flow and often divert 30 to 40 percent of the firm's pretax cash flow to the government, effectively making the government the single largest stakeholder in many firms. Having an understanding of taxation and how firms plan accordingly is important for just about any career path students choose, whether they will be an investment banker, venture capitalist, consultant, money manager, CFO, treasurer, controller, taking over a family-owned business, or an entrepreneur setting up a new business. Topics include tax planning fundamentals, corporate tax fundamentals, taxation of mergers and acquisitions, taxation of divestitures, international taxation, taxes and wealth planning.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: NCC 5000, NCC 5060.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":350031,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5020","titleShort":"Managerial Acctng & Reporting","titleLong":"Managerial Accounting and Reporting","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13175,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":14,"netid":"rdg222","firstName":"Ryan","middleName":"","lastName":"Guggenmos"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B06","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB06","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"*Open to GM, Grad, UG Srs and Jrs.*\nAdd/Drop Dates: \tJohnson Students – January 17th – February 8th.\nNon-Johnson Students – February 2nd – February 8th \nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 8th only with permission of the faculty.

The attitudes, values, and practices that prevail in their organizations induce otherwise ethical employees to take actions that violate widely shared norms of conduct. Such behavior can be costly-even disastrous-leading to ruined careers, tarnished corporate reputations, and legal liability for the individuals and their companies. In an environment where \"only results matter,\" it can be difficult for a new MBA or law school graduate to recognize the risks. If she does see the dangers, she may still find it hard to avoid them.  This course seeks to help MBAs and law students understand how a firm's culture, combined with common human tendencies, can tempt-or push-employees into unethical behavior. It also considers how employees can meet ethical challenges posed by their firms' cultures. Class sessions include discussion of case studies and readings reporting on relevant research in psychology and organizational behavior, as well as talks by noted guest speakers from the worlds of business, law, journalism, and academia. The grade in the course is based on class participation and on two written case analyses, including a final project.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":361612,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5150","titleShort":"Leadership Theory & Practice","titleLong":"Leadership Theory and Practice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13177,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"12:00PM","startDt":"01/17/2017","endDt":"01/21/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mjh35","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Hostetler"}],"pattern":"TWRFS","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"04:30PM","startDt":"01/17/2017","endDt":"01/21/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"TWRFS","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***NON-JOHNSON GRAD and UG SENIORS ONLY***\n\n** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\nDeadline for Changing Grade Option: January 17th by 4:00pm\nYou may add or drop an arranged class after the FIRST CLASS ONLY with permission of the faculty.

It will examine various new developments in retailing and the application of operations management principles to these developments. It is recommended for students interested in careers in (1) Retailing and supply chain management, (2) Businesses like banking, consulting, and information technology that provide services to retailers, and (3) Manufacturing companies that sell their products through retailers. Retailing is not only a link in the supply chain, but also an important industry for a number of reasons. This industry, more than any other, is at the forefront of business changes since it directly connects with the consumer and generates demand for the rest of the economy. It is an intensely dynamic industry, with continuous changes in marketing channels, technology, and sourcing. It has gone through remarkable developments through history, and has often been an incubator for new business concepts. Currently, retailing is leading economic growth and transformation in emerging markets around the world, both through global sourcing and global marketing. In the US, retailing comprises 40% of the economy, and is the largest employer. Problems faced by retailers are shared by other firms in the economy, and retailers are often the dominant player in a supply chain. Thus, retailing is also academically interesting as a laboratory to learn and test concepts that may apply to other businesses. Various types of sophisticated data can be collected in retailing easier than in other industries. Performance can be measured accurately and rapidly. Managers in retailing can also change their strategies and product mix in relatively short periods of time. Finally, low entry and exit barriers magnify risks and rewards in this industry, so that we find firms with stellar growth as well those with a history of bankruptcies.

The first half also covers factor investing (value &amp; momentum strategies), fixed income pricing, and performance evaluation of institutional investors such as pension funds, private equity, and hedge funds. The second half of the course studies investing in the broader global macroeconomy. What determines monetary policy and how does it affect financial markets? What are the risks and opportunities of investing in emerging markets? The second half then examines the interactions of the banking sector with financial markets, especially the role of credit and leverage, and the consequences of financial distress, including contagion, fire sales, and flight to safety.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: NCC 5060, NCC 5560, or an equivalent core finance course.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":364730,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5470","titleShort":"Long and Short of Alpha","titleLong":"The Long and Short of Liability Driven Alpha","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15306,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"03/17/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ram38","firstName":"Richard","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Marin"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B10","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB10","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Open to ALL students\n\n** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\nDeadline for Changing Grade Option: February 22nd @ 4:00pm\n\nAdd/Drop Dates: \tJohnson Students – January 17th – February 8th  \nNon-Johnson Students – February 2nd - February 8th\nYou may add or drop a first-half class after February 8th only with permission of the faculty.

At the beginning of the simulation, each team develops a strategy, and before the results of the last decision have been determined, presents an analysis of its performance, lessons learned, and its strategy for the future in a final presentation. The first course meeting is 2 hours to introduce the simulation and its mechanics as well as a discussion of company strategy. Future meetings are weekly for 2 hours which includes time for teams to review their performance and work on their company decisions. Grades are based on the value created for the company's shareholders (relative to other firms in the same industry), the team's strategy, and the instructor's evaluation of team's performance at the final presentation.

Firms in creative industries, play a role in every aspect of our lives, and influence many physical and psychological aspects of our lives, from what we eat and wear to how we entertain ourselves, but markets for cultural goods are complex and difficult to navigate. Entrepreneurs must, therefore, understand the economic sociology of the cultural market and ecosystem in order to capture economic value, a process that recursively relates to cultural norms. At the same time, the creative industries are seen by some as the last frontier for technological innovations, where many of the gains made in other sectors by pioneering entrepreneurial leaders, have not yet been realized. This course will examine why this is the case by shedding light on the underlying economic, social, and cultural rules and norms that govern the structure and functioning of these markets, in order to derive strategies and business models for entrepreneurial success. These firms thus capture economic value by transforming cultural norms in ways that appear to, and sometimes do, change the way we think and live. This course will analyze business cases of such market-pioneers in a wide range of creative industries such as art, fashion, film, food, music, publishing, and theater to explore and understand the economic, organizational, and sociological underpinnings of entrepreneurship, value(s), markets, and culture. The course is targeted towards students who wish to understand the structure of creative industries and be inspired to start, work or consult for, or invest in large and small creative, high-impact firms. The course may also interest students seeking to understand how firms offering radical innovations can create new markets by addressing the entire market ecosystem.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":350321,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5790","titleShort":"Cases in Business Strategy","titleLong":"Cases in Business Strategy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16656,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"03/20/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"hs39","firstName":"Hernan","middleName":"J.F.","lastName":"Saenz"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jhs20","firstName":"Jan","middleName":"H.","lastName":"Suwinski"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B05","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB05","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"*Johnson Students Only*\nAdd/Drop Dates: \tJohnson Students – March 20th – March 27th \nNon-Johnson Students – March 24th – March 27th \nYou may add or drop a second-half class after March 27th only with permission of the faculty.

It created a new emphasis on information technologies and systems in management; led to the development of new technologies and new combinations of existing technologies to support management; and occasionally radically altered business practices and the role of management.

What special challenges face women as they transition from students to managers to leaders? What do the latest research findings offer to women who are seeking C-level positions and the organizations that want to benefit from more women leaders? In this course, we will take a multi-pronged approach to learning about women and leadership to better prepare students of both genders to lead in organizations that are now comprised of nearly 50% women. To do this we will analyze case studies of women leaders pulled from a range of industries. We will review the current state of empirical evidence about the status of women as leaders, investigate the barriers that have made it more difficult for women to reach the top of the business world, and consider ways in which individuals and organizations can overcome them. Guest speakers will share their experiences with the class. Finally, there will be time to engage in deep reflection about what students expect from their careers, as well as a chance to consider the pathways they must take to become effective and inclusive leaders in increasingly diverse organizations.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":364726,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6180","titleShort":"Global Innovation & Technology","titleLong":"Global Innovation and Technology Commercialization","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15439,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"06:00PM","startDt":"03/03/2017","endDt":"03/03/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":9,"netid":"wds4","firstName":"Wesley","middleName":"","lastName":"Sine"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B06","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB06","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"05:00PM","startDt":"03/04/2017","endDt":"03/04/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"S","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B06","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB06","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":3,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"06:00PM","startDt":"03/17/2017","endDt":"03/24/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":4,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"05:00PM","startDt":"03/25/2017","endDt":"03/25/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"S","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Open to ALL Students\nStudents can drop after the FIRST CLASS ONLY - by sending an email to the Johnson School Registrar's Office at gm-registrar@cornell.edu.

Three methods of valuation are introduced: intrinsic valuation, relative valuation by multiples using comparables, and contingent claims valuation, based on a real options approach. The rest of the course will be dedicated to understanding each of these methods in greater detail and more importantly, applying them to the valuation of actual companies. This will involve understanding in detail discounted cash-flow models and the many inputs required to build them; dividend discount models; the determination and use of relative-value multiples such as price/earnings and price/book value; and finally, how to apply option theory to specific problems in valuation. The course includes a special session on valuation approaches and challenges specific to venture capital and private-equity investing. This will include a discussion of topics such as required internal rates of return (IRRs), the effects of leverage on valuation, and issues relating to the valuation of high-growth startups.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":364724,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6620","titleShort":"Product Marketing Insights","titleLong":"Product Marketing Insights","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13284,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mkt27","firstName":"Manoj","middleName":"","lastName":"Thomas"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"*Open to GM, Grad and UG Srs.*\nNon-Johnson students may add themselves to the waitlists during the enrollment periods, however Johnson Students have priority into the classes and non-Johnsons will be enrolled: 1) IF seats are still available after Johnson students complete their enrollment period and 2) IF the instructor allows.\n\nAdd/Drop Dates: \tJohnson Students – January 17th – February 8th.\nNon-Johnson Students – February 2nd – February 8th \nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 8th only with permission of the faculty.

In the past, some students from the Engineering, Hotel, AEM (Dyson) and ILR programs have also attended this course. Impactful business leaders appreciate the importance of consumer insights. Many strategic decisions - such as introducing a new product, repositioning an existing product, or deciding whether to extend an existing brand or to introduce a new brand - are pivoted on consumer insights. In this course I will discuss how managers can uncover behavioral insights and use those insights to shape product marketing strategy. The course will cover the following four topics: CONSUMER INSIGHTS (What is consumer insight? What research methods can be used to uncover consumer insights?), POSITIONING &amp; BRANDING (Can you do the financial analysis required for a marketing plan? Why is positioning so important? Which segment should you target? Can intangible brand associations influence market shares? Should you extend your brand?  How is brand value measured?), INNOVATION (Do you have to be a pioneer to successfully innovate? How can new product diffusion be modeled? Is your category lifecycle slow-and-long or fast-and-short? How to test a concept? How can you optimize the attributes of your new concept? How can you forecast the sales of the new product?), PRICING &amp; ADVERTISING (Will a higher price help or hurt your brand? Does share-of-voice predict market share?). Please note that there is a significant overlap between the material taught in this course and the Strategic Brand Management course (NBA 6240) taught by me in the Strategic Marketing Immersion program. Therefore students, who have already attended the Strategic Marketing Immersion course will not be allowed to enroll for this course.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":350671,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6650","titleShort":"Strat Mgmt of Tech & Innov","titleLong":"The Strategic Management of Technology and Innovation","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13192,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"05:40PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":11,"netid":"rll36","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"Louis","lastName":"Laperle"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Open to GM and Grad Students Only \r\n\r\nNon-Johnson students may add themselves to the waitlists during the enrollment periods, however Johnson Students have priority into the classes and non-Johnsons will be enrolled: 1) IF seats are still available after Johnson students complete their enrollment period and 2) IF the instructor allows.\r\n\r\nAdd/Drop Dates: \tJohnson Students – January 17th – February 8th.\r\nNon-Johnson Students – February 2nd – February 8th \r\nYou may add or drop a full semester class after February 8th only with permission of the faculty.

This course is designed for students who may someday work in, consult for, and/or create firms whose primary product is fundamentally related to technology or innovation. The course typically includes both M.B.A. students and graduate students in science. It starts by examining how industries are transformed by new technologies and how these patterns of industrial change generate both opportunity and high rates of firm failure. We will then explore the questions: Why do some technology leaders fail? and How do technology innovators successfully take on and replace incumbent firms? This leads to an examination of internal management issues, focusing on the design of innovative organizations: designing reward systems, managing growth, overcoming resistance to change, and using organizational culture to promote innovation.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368109,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6682","titleShort":"Crisis Comm. for Business Ldrs","titleLong":"Crisis Communications for Business Leaders","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16645,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"03/17/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"tk626","firstName":"Theomary","middleName":"","lastName":"Karamanis"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 134","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH134","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"** MUST ATTEND FIRST CLASS **\nAdd/Drop Dates: \tJohnson Students – January 17th – February 8th  \nNon-Johnson Students – February 2nd - February 8th\nYou may add or drop a first-half class after February 8th only with permission of the faculty.
