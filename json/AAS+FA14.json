But, who are the \"Asians?\" On what basis can we label \"Asians\" an ethnic group? Although there is a significant Asian presence in the Caribbean, the category \"Asian\" itself does not exist in the Caribbean. What does this say about the nature of categories that label and demarcate groups of people on the basis of alleged cultural and phenotypical characteristics? This course will examine the dynamics behind group identity, namely ethnicity, by comparing and contrasting the multicultural experience of Asian populations in the Caribbean and the United States. Ethnographic case studies will focus on the East Indian and Chinese experiences in the Caribbean and the Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Filipino, and Indian experiences in the United States.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":359416,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"AAS","catalogNbr":"3470","titleShort":"Asian American Women's Hist","titleLong":"Asian American Women's History","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17797,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":6,"netid":"cyl58","firstName":"Chrissy","middleName":"Yee","lastName":"Lau"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Rockefeller Hall 189","bldgDescr":"Rockefeller Hall","facilityDescrshort":"RCK189","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3470","type":"C"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"3470","type":"C"},{"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"3470","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course examines the experiences and representations of Asian American women from the mid-19th century to the present.
