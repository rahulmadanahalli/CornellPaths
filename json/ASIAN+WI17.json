The Angkorian Empire, situated now in the province of Siem Reap in Cambodia, once stretched across much of Mainland Southeast Asia from the 9th to the 15th centuries. Early inscriptions relate how Khmer dancers wrapped in sumptuous silks were presented as offerings to temples. This 2 week Cornell in Cambodia course will encourage students in an embodied way to explore how the creative and political fastening of the lived world to a spiritual place like Angkor has a long and richly embedded history combining dance, silk and stone. Students will visit sacred sites, weaving workshops, observe dance classes and performances, and explore Cambodia's National Museum.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-ITL)","catalogWhenOffered":"Winter.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"}]
