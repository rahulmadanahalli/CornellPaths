Basic grammar and vocabulary are covered, including explanations of the fundamental parts of a sign, proper use of fingerspelling, and the significance of nonmanual features. Instruction is supplemented with videotexts allowing students to begin to explore the visual literature of the Deaf community in the United States-stories, poems, and jokes that are unique to Deaf culture. Readings and class discussions acquaint students with the causes of deafness, the historical development of ASL and its linguistic status, and characteristics of deaf education both throughout history and in the present day.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2664,"crseId":351444,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"LING","catalogNbr":"1170","titleShort":"Intro to Cognitive Science","titleLong":"Introduction to Cognitive Science","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1510,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"06/26/2017","endDt":"08/04/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

Instead, an objective, deliberated, and multidisciplinary approach is necessary.  To that end, cognitive science draws on, and integrates, at least five disciplines: Psychology, Neuroscience, Computer Science, Linguistics, and Philosophy.  This course provides an introduction to the insights that these disciplines offer cognitive science while introducing students to current understanding of attention, memory, visual perception, learning, problem solving, language comprehension, and consciousness. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(KCM-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring, summer (six-week session).","catalogComments":"A 1 credit Writing in the Majors sections is available, LING 1104.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"}]
