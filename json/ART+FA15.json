Special attention will be given not only to the literary sources that shaped art theory, practice, and criticism but also to important issues such as propaganda, the viewer's emotional engagement, and the artist's social status. The unity of the visual arts, rhetorical effects, artistic rivalry, scenic urbanism, the relation between art and poetry, the use of classical and \"bizarre\" vocabulary, the concept of pastoral, the representation of ecstasy, and the idealization of death will be some of the themes explored in this course.

Topics may include art education; site and context specificity; nomadism; and diverse understandings of art as an autonomous entity and in relation to society and the self. The course also addresses art forms and mediums in dialogue with one another as they have unfolded historically. From installation, performance, video and conceptual practices of the 60's and 70's which explored the physical and ontological limits of art, to the \"Pictures\" and Post-Conceptual generation that problematized art institutions and cultural, political and economic realms, to present day project based and relational aesthetic practices that employ dialogue as a medium. Readings include key texts from critical and aesthetic theory.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: M.F.A. students in Art.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AR"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":359118,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"ART","catalogNbr":"6690","titleShort":"Comparative Modernities","titleLong":"Comparative Modernities","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16668,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"09:25PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mid1","firstName":"Iftikhar","middleName":"","lastName":"Dadi"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 144","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH144","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPI","gradingBasisShort":"Opt NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option(OPI)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"4690","type":"C"},{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"6190","type":"C"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4641","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Since the late 19th century, the effects of capitalism across the globe have been profoundly transformative and have intensified with the demise of the older colonial empires, the rise of nationalism and independent states, and the onset of neoliberal globalization. These transformations are manifested in the domains of high art, mass culture and popular culture, yet remain inadequately studied. This seminar theorizes and explores non-Western modernist and postmodernist art practice in a comparative framework. Taught as a seminar, it assumes active participation by advanced undergraduate and graduate students who have a prior knowledge of Euro-American modernism and art history, and who wish to better understand the great artistic and visual transformations in the 20th century in a global context.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AR"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":363107,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ART","catalogNbr":"7001","titleShort":"Graduate
