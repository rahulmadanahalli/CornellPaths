This course combines acting and movement techniques encouraging process-oriented work. Focusing on performance in civic spaces, the class works to examine the politics of status and the social role of bodily (including vocal) expression of both performer and audience.  Working within the specific context of urban public spaces, the class will question the function of monument and the character of urbanism in relation to individual bodies while understanding how these bodies combine to create a body politic. The class will consider traditional tools of political and social satire, including Commedia dellArte.  Fundamental in commedia is the exploration of status, the gradation of power and influence and role-playing. Students will create their own texts and movement as well as draw from other textual and visual sources. The class will conclude with a public performance.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2594,"crseId":359606,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"3210","titleShort":"Ancient/Modern Corpo-realit","titleLong":"Ancient/Modern Corpo-Realities","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1446,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:00AM","timeEnd":"12:00PM","startDt":"06/30/2015","endDt":"07/28/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"pbs6","firstName":"P.","middleName":"","lastName":"Suber"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Offered in Rome.

Topics include examination of the ways in which class relates to social and public space and urban space as performance. Additional course work in film production, performance, and writing allows students to re-inscribe their spatial/corporeal experiences into an alternative exhibition space of the city street or the written page. In addition, each student will be required to produce formal textual documentation and full textual analyses of this process and final performance, installation, or text-based product.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2594,"crseId":363031,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4696","titleShort":"The Art Market","titleLong":"The Art Market","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"100","classNbr":1615,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"06/07/2015","endDt":"06/28/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"cf86","firstName":"Cheryl","middleName":"","lastName":"Finley"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Online Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

We will study the production, sale and exchange of works of art as well as the patrons, artists and collectors who participate in this economic, social and political form of taste-making and aesthetic valuation. Students will learn about noted patrons of the arts, such as the Medici family in Renaissance Italy, our main focus will be on the creation of a global art market in the twentieth century. Using case studies, sample topics include: patterns of transportation, exchange and trade; the interaction of collectors, critics and curators; the spaces and contexts of display of contemporary collections; auction houses and commercial galleries; and fakes, forgeries, thefts and scandals. Special attention will be paid to considering the contemporary art market (post 1980) and the collecting, exchange and valuation of film, photography, painting, performance and installation art. Global markets for the exchange of art in Asia, Europe, Africa, North America and South America will be highlighted as well as the exhibitions of contemporary art such as the Art Basel, the Cairo Biennale and the Venice Biennale that fuel these markets.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with AMST 6696/ARTH 6696.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"}]
