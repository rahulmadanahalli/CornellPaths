Most of the selection and priority of these topics is guided by the interest (and votes) of participants. Recent topics have included: affect in decision making, attention (allocation and focus), coherence/consistency of beliefs, fluency, goals, individual differences, information distortion, memory, methods, neuroscience, non-conscious processes, self-control-regulatory focus-ego depletion, and System 1 versus System 2. Students taking this course for credit are expected (a) to lead the discussions for several of the weekly topics, including the selection of the articles assigned as readings and the development of study questions and (b) to prepare a final paper that is presented in preliminary oral form during one of the last class meetings. The paper can review a body of literature, present a new theory or framework, or report an original experiment (or only a proposal for an experiment). Auditors are only expected to lead several weekly sessions.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"","catalogComments":"Graduate standing.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":364608,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NRE","catalogNbr":"5210","titleShort":"Doctoral Pro Sem Marketing","titleLong":"Doctoral Pro Seminar - Marketing","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17563,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"05:40PM","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"vrr2","firstName":"Vithala","middleName":"R.","lastName":"Rao"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Open to Non-Johnson Graduate Students:  August 14th at 8:00am thru September 10th at 4:00pm.

It consists of three parts. The first part covers arbitrage pricing theory, including the Black Scholes Merton, the Heath Jarrow Morton, and reduced form credit risk models. The second part covers portfolio theory, in both complete and incomplete markets. The third part studies equilibrium pricing models, both complete and incomplete markets, including the notion of market efficiency. This course emphasizes continuous time models and it is based on the use of martingales to understand asset pricing theory. Included in the course is the extensions of the standard theories to include asset price bubbles.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"}]
