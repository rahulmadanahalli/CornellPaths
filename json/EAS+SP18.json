many fascinating examples of fluid dynamics phenomena that are also of societal importance. Turbulent convection in the outer core generates the earth's magnetic field. The viscous mantle (outer half of the Earth) is slowly but vigorously convecting, and consequently the Earth's surface is dynamic. Viscosity is not important in the oceans and atmosphere, but the flow there is fast enough for the rotation of the Earth to become a dominant control. Electromagnetic effects again dominate in the solar wind and magnetosphere. This course investigates the Earth using fluid dynamics. For students in the Earth sciences it provides an opportunity to learn the insights that can be provided by fluid dynamics. For students who know fluid dynamics from other fields the course provides spectacular applications and an opportunity to learn about the Earth system in a different and unusually fundamental way.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: math through MATH 2940, physics through PHYS 2208 or PHYS 2214, or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"EN"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":367842,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"EAS","catalogNbr":"5740","titleShort":"Quant Data Anlys in Geosci","titleLong":"Quantitative Data Analysis for the Geosciences","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":12221,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"gaa52","firstName":"Geoffrey","middleName":"","lastName":"Abers"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Prerequisite: two semesters of calculus and coursework in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the 3000-level or above.
