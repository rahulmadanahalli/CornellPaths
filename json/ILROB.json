It can be planned or unplanned, proactive or reactive, and it can involve fundamental transformation or only incremental adjustments. This course examines organizational change from both a theoretical and practical perspective. To do so, the course pairs readings drawn from Sociology and Social Psychology with case studies and in-class exercises that put you inside real organizations and give you experience making decisions in the face of ambiguous and incomplete information. We focus first on the tensions that arise when establishing and changing the design and structure of an organization. Next, we consider change in organizational culture-the assumptions, norms, and practices shared by members or a group or organization. In the final module, we examine how individuals within organizations lead and manage change.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: ILROB 1220.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"FA14"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":355543,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILROB","catalogNbr":"3290","titleShort":"Organizational Cultures","titleLong":"Organizational Cultures","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15128,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"wjs7","firstName":"William","middleName":"James","lastName":"Sonnenstuhl"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 111","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS111","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Reviews the concept of culture as it has evolved in sociology and anthropology, applying it to formal organizations in workplaces such as corporations and unions. The course first examines the nature of ideologies as sense-making definitions of behavior, concentrating on the cultural forms that carry these cultural messages, rituals, symbols, myths, sagas, legends, and organizational stories. Considerable attention is given to rites and ceremonials as a cultural form in organizational life that consolidates many of these expressive forms into one. The course examines types of ceremonial behavior such as rites of passage, rites of enhancement, and rites of degradation, including the role of language gestures, physical settings, and artifacts in ceremonial behavior. The presence of subcultures and countercultures in organizational behavior also receive attention, especially the part played by occupational subcultures in formal organizations.

with growing income inequality, with the increasing visibility of inter-country differences in wealth and income, and with the persistence of racial, ethnic, and gender stratification. This course introduces students to ongoing social scientific debates about the sources and consequences of inequality, as well as the types of public policy that might appropriately be pursued to reduce (or increase) inequality. These topics will be addressed in related unites, some of which include guest lectures by faculty from other universities (funded by the Center for the Study of Inequality).

We focus first on the tensions that arise when establishing and changing the design and structure of an organization. Next, we consider change in organizational culture-the assumptions, norms, and practices shared by members or a group or organization.

to be a Cornellian and engaged in campus life and the world beyond? Culture defines who we are as a member of Cornell University and how we should act toward one another and in the wider world. This course will examine the concept of culture and apply it to our role as Cornellians. Values matter. They tell us what is important in our lives. Effective leaders use culture to strengthen members' commitment to the organization and keep members focused on the organization's goals. In that sense, culture is a powerful form of social control that can be utilized to encourage and discourage specific behaviors. As an institution, Cornell University espouses values that all Cornellians believe in. Academic excellence, collective and individual responsibility, philanthropy, and fairness are a few that come to mind. While such values are central to Cornell, powerful voices have characterized student culture by a variety of negative terms, including \"binge drinking,\" \"sexual violence,\" and \"hazing.\" Cornellians do not condone such behaviors and most students act responsibly. Indeed, understanding the concept of culture and how student leaders use it to promote commitment can go a long way toward deterring these problems and managing the minority of students who engage in such unwanted behavior.

with growing income inequality, with the increasing visibility of inter-country differences in wealth and income, and with the persistence of racial, ethnic, and gender stratification. This course introduces students to ongoing social scientific debates about the sources and consequences of inequality, as well as the types of public policy that might appropriately be pursued to reduce (or increase) inequality. These topics will be addressed in related units, some of which include guest lectures by faculty from other universities (funded by the Center for the Study of Inequality).

to be a Cornellian and engaged in campus life and the world beyond? Culture defines who we are as a member of Cornell University and how we should act toward one another and in the wider world. This course will examine the concept of culture and apply it to our role as Cornellians. Values matter. They tell us what is important in our lives. Effective leaders use culture to strengthen members' commitment to the organization and keep members focused on the organization's goals. In that sense, culture is a powerful form of social control that can be utilized to encourage and discourage specific behaviors. As an institution, Cornell University espouses values that all Cornellians believe in. Academic excellence, collective and individual responsibility, philanthropy, and fairness are a few that come to mind. While such values are central to Cornell, powerful voices have characterized student culture by a variety of negative terms, including \"binge drinking,\" \"sexual violence,\" and \"hazing.\" Cornellians do not condone such behaviors and most students act responsibly. Indeed, understanding the concept of culture and how student leaders use it to promote commitment can go a long way toward deterring these problems and managing the minority of students who engage in such unwanted behavior.

Organizations are constantly adapting to changing environments and employees are constantly required to adapt to new organizational settings. This adaptation is not simple, and employees exhibit a large variety of responses to it, ranging from active resistance to proactive championing. In this course we will focus on these, its sources, and the routes to researching it. Contrary to most investigations of the change process, our focus will be on the employee's perspective of the change process. Our aim will be to learn about the different reasons employees have for resisting or supporting changes, and the means through which these reasons have been studied. We will address a variety of possible sources and consider the implications of these sources for the effective management of change. We will analyze several cases in class, through which we will learn to identify and better understand the antecedents of employees' reactions to change.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368730,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"ILROB","catalogNbr":"3770","titleShort":"Money, Work and Social Life","titleLong":"Money, Work and Social Life","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18380,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"fg266","firstName":"Filiz","middleName":"","lastName":"Garip"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"Morrill Hall 106","bldgDescr":"Morrill Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MRL106","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"3770","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Through a diverse set of readings and other media, this course offers a multi-disciplinary account of how our economic life (money and work) is intertwined with our social life (networks and culture).

with growing income inequality, with the increasing visibility of inter-country differences in wealth and income, and with the persistence of racial, ethnic, and gender stratification. This course introduces students to ongoing social scientific debates about the sources and consequences of inequality, as well as the types of public policy that might appropriately be pursued to reduce (or increase) inequality. These topics will be addressed in related units, some of which include guest lectures by faculty from other universities (funded by the Center for the Study of Inequality). Each unit culminates with a highly spirited class discussion and debate.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":364507,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILROB","catalogNbr":"2290","titleShort":"Organizational Cultures","titleLong":"Organizational Cultures","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16399,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"wjs7","firstName":"William","middleName":"James","lastName":"Sonnenstuhl"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Reviews the concept of organizational culture.

to be a Cornellian and engaged in campus life and the world beyond? Culture defines who we are as a member of Cornell University and how we should act toward one another and in the wider world. This course will examine the concept of culture and apply it to our role as Cornellians. Values matter. They tell us what is important in our lives. Effective leaders use culture to strengthen members' commitment to the organization and keep members focused on the organization's goals. In that sense, culture is a powerful form of social control that can be utilized to encourage and discourage specific behaviors. As an institution, Cornell University espouses values that all Cornellians believe in. Academic excellence, collective and individual responsibility, philanthropy, and fairness are a few that come to mind. While such values are central to Cornell, powerful voices have characterized student culture by a variety of negative terms, including \"binge drinking,\" \"sexual violence,\" and \"hazing.\" Cornellians do not condone such behaviors and most students act responsibly. Indeed, understanding the concept of culture and how student leaders use it to promote commitment can go a long way toward deterring these problems and managing the minority of students who engage in such unwanted behavior.

In response, the boundaries between the for-profit and non-profit sectors have become increasingly blurred, as organizations and their leaders seek new solutions. Corporations engage in corporate social responsibility and social intrapreneurship, while traditional non-profits incorporate business practices in an effort to more efficiently and effectively pursue their social missions. In between, there are growing numbers of hybrid social enterprises whose raison d’etre is to address social issues through commercial ventures. This course explores these varied models for managing and leading social innovation. We will examine for-profit, non-profit, and hybrid approaches, focusing on the unique challenges and opportunities of each approach and the leadership skills needed to effectively address them. Through readings, class discussion, guest speakers, interactive exercises, and a final project with a community partner, students will master theoretical frameworks and gain practical knowledge and experience that will equip them to manage and lead social innovation in new and existing organizations across a variety of contexts."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":null,"catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":362578,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILROB","catalogNbr":"4260","titleShort":"Managing Creativity","titleLong":"Managing for Creativity","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16414,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Although most people can agree that creativity is an important concept, there is often very little agreement about what creativity is and how we can achieve it.
