International finance is different in two basic respects: (1) the existence of multiple currencies adds risk to investment and financing decisions; (2) when corporations and portfolio investors cross international borders, both problems and opportunities arise. This course focuses on these issues and highlights how finance theory can be extended to address them. Students apply the basic principles of international finance to a variety of problems. The course helps students understand the ideas and research results of international finance and adapt what they learn to the practical problems in the increasingly globalized business world. The first part of the course outlines exchange rate volatility, barriers to international capital flows, and the value of international diversification. The second part presents a variety of problems, examples, and applications from the three basic themes described in part one.

The projects are done by teams of students, typically four, supported by both the faculty and an experienced adviser. Lecture material covers the approach to structuring complex problems, conducting analytical work and developing conclusions and recommendations. Student teams are expected to communicate regularly with their clients and to have at least interim and final presentations. These experiential-learning projects will integrate the concepts and knowledge covered in the core courses and immersions as well as other fall electives. These client-critical projects typically incorporate the broad areas of strategy, operations, finance or marketing.

Unlike traditional finance theories, behavioral finance argues that some financial market phenomena can plausibly be understood only under the assumption that some market participants are not fully rational.

Topics include: (1) investor psychological bias and irrational trading behavior, and how to overcome our own biases in stock trading; (2) limits of arbitrage and the risk of leveraged convergence trading; (3) stock index market timing (and why market timing is far more important in emerging markets around the world than in the US); (4) typical behavioral finance approaches in constructing outperforming stock portfolios (including value, momentum, size, earnings quality, corporate governance, effects of short-sale constraint, and many other effects); (5) applying behavioral finance concepts to understanding China's stock market (as an example of emerging equity markets).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":365543,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6029","titleShort":"NYC Technology Trek","titleLong":"NYC Technology Trek","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13436,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"10/10/2014","endDt":"10/10/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"wds4","firstName":"Wesley","middleName":"","lastName":"Sine"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Trip Date: October 10th\r\nBY PERMISSION ONLY.

Modeling topics include the art of finding the appropriate level of modeling detail, practice in dealing with vague and unstructured problems, sensitivity analysis, and working with incomplete and unreliable data.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":350620,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6440","titleShort":"Competition from Emergng Mrkts","titleLong":"Competition from Emerging Markets: The New Emerging Multinationals","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15399,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"10/20/2014","endDt":"11/17/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lc683","firstName":"Lourdes","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Casanova"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"10:00AM","timeEnd":"01:00PM","startDt":"10/31/2014","endDt":"10/31/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lc683","firstName":"Lourdes","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Casanova"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":3,"timeStart":"10:00AM","timeEnd":"01:00PM","startDt":"11/14/2014","endDt":"11/14/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lc683","firstName":"Lourdes","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Casanova"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":4,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"12/01/2014","endDt":"12/01/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lc683","firstName":"Lourdes","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Casanova"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"**JOHNSON, GRAD AND UG SENIORS ONLY**\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students August 11th thru September 9th with an additional Add/Drop period beginning October 15th at 8:00am to October 21st at 4:00pm. \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  October 20th at 8:00am to October 21st at 4:00pm.

In particular, we study the fundamentals of commodity futures returns and momentum strategy on commodity investment, the carry trade and momentum strategy on currency investment, the volatility strategy on option investment. In addition to delivering trading strategies, we pay close attention to common risk factors behind these investment strategies. Special topics change from one year to another to reflect recent trends and practices in industry, and also the state-of-art research in academia.

How do scientists and entrepreneurs find and create market opportunities? Commercializing University Science and High Technology will tackle these issues and apply our learning to projects drawn from Cornell labs and local high-tech firms. This course is designed to help students identify, evaluate, and obtain control over technology opportunities. The course focuses on three themes: (1) the source, discovery, and evaluation of technological opportunities on a university campus; (2) increasing the efficiency of the innovation process to produce new technologies that satisfy customer needs; and (3) the different mechanisms available to appropriate returns from technology. The course uses readings, cases, and discussions with practitioners to examine this phenomenon. After completing this class, students will be familiar with basic principles related to technology entrepreneurship and will have gained a deeper understanding of the technology commercialization process at Cornell. The class will be composed of a select group of graduate students drawn from science, engineering, law, medicine, and the Johnson Graduate School of Business (enrollment is limited).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":361754,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6600","titleShort":"Corporate Social Responsibil","titleLong":"Corporate Social Responsibility","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15374,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"10/13/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dmr42","firstName":"Dana","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Radcliffe"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 134","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH134","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"**JOHNSON, GRAD AND UG SENIORS ONLY**\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students August 11th thru September 9th with an additional Add/Drop period beginning October 15th at 8:00am to October 21st at 4:00pm. \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  October 20th at 8:00am to October 21st at 4:00pm.

These initiatives, commonly viewed as efforts in \"corporate social responsibility\" (CSR), stem from the growing conviction-among senior executives as well as other stakeholders-that business must be \"part of the solution\" of problems that threaten communities and even the planet itself. At the same time, corporations are not charities, and corporate managers must strive (within legal and ethical constraints) to serve the interests of shareholders. Consequently, firms that engage in CSR must find ways to meet social needs and protect the natural environment that are in line with the companies' strategic goals. Drawing from the recent literature on CSR, this course uses articles and book excerpts to acquaint students with current ideas and best practices in the field. The readings are generally supplemented by at least one guest speaker from a leading corporate practitioner of CSR. Class discussion of case studies gives students the chance to analyze CSR challenges confronted by specific companies and to identify and critically evaluate possible responses to those challenges. A final project, assigned to two-person teams, entails students' developing recommendations-supported by detailed analysis-for a particular company in its pursuit of \"strategic CSR.\"","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":366853,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6610","titleShort":"Nonprofit Gov & Leadership","titleLong":"Nonprofit Governance and Leadership","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18025,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"09/08/2014","endDt":"09/08/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jeg68","firstName":"Joe","middleName":"","lastName":"Grasso"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"09/22/2014","endDt":"09/22/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jeg68","firstName":"Joe","middleName":"","lastName":"Grasso"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":3,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"10/06/2014","endDt":"10/06/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jeg68","firstName":"Joe","middleName":"","lastName":"Grasso"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":4,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"10/20/2014","endDt":"10/20/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jeg68","firstName":"Joe","middleName":"","lastName":"Grasso"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":5,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"11/03/2014","endDt":"11/03/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jeg68","firstName":"Joe","middleName":"","lastName":"Grasso"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":6,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"11/17/2014","endDt":"11/17/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jeg68","firstName":"Joe","middleName":"","lastName":"Grasso"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":7,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"07:10PM","startDt":"12/01/2014","endDt":"12/01/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jeg68","firstName":"Joe","middleName":"","lastName":"Grasso"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B11","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB11","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Add/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students Â¿ August 11th at 8:00am to September 9th at 4:00pm.

Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more interdependent parties. The purpose of this course is to understand the theory and processes of negotiation as it is practiced in a variety of settings. It is designed to complement the technical and diagnostic skills learned in other courses. A basic premise is that while a manager needs analytical skills to develop optimal solutions to problems, he or she also needs a broad array of negotiation skills for these solutions to be accepted and implemented. The course highlights the components of an effective negotiation and teaches students to analyze their own behavior in negotiations. It is largely experiential, giving students an opportunity to develop their skills by participating in negotiations and integrating their experiences with the principles presented in the assigned readings and course discussions.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":350688,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6700","titleShort":"Becoming a Leader","titleLong":"Becoming a Leader","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15385,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:55AM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"10/13/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":9,"netid":"hll37","firstName":"Hannes","middleName":"","lastName":"Leroy"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B08","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB08","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"THIS SECTION FOR NON-JOHNSON GRAD AND UG SRS/JRS ONLY\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  August 11th thru September 9th with an additional Add/Drop period beginning October 15th at 8:00am to October 21st at 4:00pm.

In general, an organization cannot survive without the trust of numerous stakeholders, and ethical lapses destroy trust and threaten vital stakeholder relationships. In today's volatile and fiercely competitive business environment, a manager must be able to identify and effectively resolve ethical issues that inevitably arise in the pursuit of business (and career) objectives. This course is designed to enhance students' skills in moral reasoning as it applies to managerial decision making. It begins by examining normative concepts and principles that typically enter into moral reasoning, then uses those concepts and principles to analyze cases. Discussions are designed to help students understand the moral issues confronting the decision makers in the cases and explore how those issues might be addressed in ethically responsible ways.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":350704,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6730","titleShort":"Derivatives Securities Part I","titleLong":"Derivatives Securities Part I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15300,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"10/10/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":9,"netid":"pg297","firstName":"George","middleName":"","lastName":"Gao"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***GM, GRAD and UG SRS/JRS ONLY***.  \r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students Â¿ August 11th at 8:00am to September 9th at 4:00pm.

Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more interdependent parties. The purpose of this course is to understand the theory and processes of negotiation as it is practiced in a variety of settings. This course is designed to complement the technical and diagnostic skills learned in other courses at the Johnson School. A basic premise of the course is that while a manager needs analytical skills to develop optimal solutions, a broad array of negotiation skills is needed in order for these solutions to be accepted and implemented. The course is designed to help students approach negotiations with confidence. They have the opportunity to develop their negotiating skills experientially and to gain insight into what works, what does not, and why.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":350746,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6930","titleShort":"Strategy & Tactics of Pricing","titleLong":"Strategy and Tactics of Pricing","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13369,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"vrr2","firstName":"Vithala","middleName":"R.","lastName":"Rao"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B06","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB06","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***JOHNSON AND GRAD STUDENTS ONLY***.\r\n UG SENIORS BY PERMISSION ONLY.\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students: August 11th at 8:00am to September 9th at 4:00pm.
