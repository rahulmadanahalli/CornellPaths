course designed to introduce first-year students to lawyering skills, with primary emphasis on legal writing, analysis, research, and oral presentations. Assignments are usually set in the context of a simulated law office (or judge's chambers). In the fall semester, students write predictive memoranda that point out the strengths and weaknesses of their client's case. To prepare the memoranda, students may need to determine the facts of the case by conducting interviews or depositions. Acting as junior attorneys, students will also make an oral presentation to a supervising attorney. The spring semester focuses on persuasive advocacy. Students prepare a memorandum, motion, or brief for submission to a court and, later, orally argue for their positions in a simulated court session. Throughout the year, students also learn the fundamentals of legal research. Instruction occurs not only in full-class sessions but also in individual conferences. Students receive extensive feedback on each major assignment.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring (yearlong).","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":350053,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"5090","titleShort":"Advanced Financial Stat Analy","titleLong":"Advanced Financial Statement Analysis","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15629,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":8,"netid":"kjm267","firstName":"Kenneth","middleName":"Joe","lastName":"Merkley"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B10","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB10","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5090","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"10/10/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"002","classNbr":15630,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":8,"netid":"kjm267","firstName":"Kenneth","middleName":"Joe","lastName":"Merkley"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5090","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"10/10/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"003","classNbr":15631,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":8,"netid":"kjm267","firstName":"Kenneth","middleName":"Joe","lastName":"Merkley"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"10/10/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5090","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"10/10/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"}],"description":"This course builds on the material of NBA 5060 and focuses on more advanced financial statement topics and specialized industries.

The course attempts to provide a general working knowledge of the financial system by examining not only how various intermediaries and markets work, but also their evolution over time.  The role of central banks, and their operations, is particularly emphasized, as is the nature of risk management both within the financial institution and more broadly for the financial system.

Indeed, many cases are lost, won, or settled because of information gleaned at a deposition. Attorneys also often modify trial strategies because of a witness's performance at a deposition. Because depositions play such an important role in litigation, the majority of junior litigation attorneys can expect to deal with depositions in some manner from the very start of their careers. This introductory course will expose students to several facets of a deposition: preparing for deposition, asking questions at a deposition, defending the witness at a deposition, using documents at a deposition, and reviewing the transcript of a deposition. Students can expect to take and defend mock depositions and to observe and critique their fellow students' deposition skills.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"Forbidden Overlap: students who have already taken Pretrial Discovery: Depositions (two-credit class) or Deposition Skills (one-credit class) may not enroll in this class.","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the skills requirement.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":364111,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6572","titleShort":"Intro Transactional Lawyering","titleLong":"Introduction to Transactional Lawyering","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18042,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:05AM","startDt":"08/24/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"cwb94","firstName":"Celia","middleName":"","lastName":"Bigoness"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 290","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH290","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/24/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The conventional law school curriculum implicitly emphasizes appellate litigation, teaching students to read, argue and distinguish cases, and to predict what a judge will do.

Opinions have long varied, however, over just how money and finance shape macroeconomic phenomena, and thus over what legal and institutional structures are best suited to yielding financial and macroeconomic optima. This course, co-taught by a financially trained and experienced lawyer and a legally trained and experienced financier, both with backgrounds in macroeconomics, critically examines the linkages among law, money, and financial macrodynamics, as well as the thought of some leading thinkers and policymakers in these fields over the past century or so. Each week students will have read, and will actively discuss, several assigned texts. All class sessions will be led by the two instructors, but we hope during some weeks to bring in distinguished guest speakers as well, ideally including one or two Nobel Laureates.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":366067,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7440","titleShort":"Law and Social Change","titleLong":"Law and Social Change: Comparative Law in Africa","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18157,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:10PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"08/24/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mbn5","firstName":"Muna","middleName":"B.","lastName":"Ndulo"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 389","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH389","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar is designed for students interested in a comparative study of law in Africa. The seminar will include an introduction to multiple African legal systems, as well as African customary law, constitutional law, labor law, property law and family law. The seminar will examine the current law in the context of changes that have taken place in African society from colonization through the present day. Students will read cases and statutes from multiple African countries. Students will be encouraged to choose an area of law to conduct a comparative analysis in the required final paper. The seminar creates opportunities for multicultural experiences through immersion in South Africa's society and culture during a three-week winter trip to Johannesburg, South Africa, where students will receive instruction at the University of Johannesburg. (Travel assistance will be available based on demonstrated need. Please contact, Program Manager, IAD at 190 Uris Hall for more information.) The main objective of this aspect of the program is to enhance and reinforce academic learning by providing students the opportunity to actively engage with individuals and organizations directly involved in the administration of law in Africa in a variety of concentrations. The seminar will examine problems of law and how they have been addressed in Africa with particular attention to the interaction of the common law, African customary law, and other imported systems of law. Legal interaction between Africa and Europe, which began before colonial rule, intensified during the colonial period and has continued after independence. During the Colonial period, the Common Law and Civil law were imported into Africa and operated alongside customary law. The result is that pluralism of law is a common feature of legal systems in nearly all African states. The conflicts between the imported laws and customary law have generated considerable interest in reform and the integration of laws in various African countries as well as creating an opportunity to look to other legal system for alternative approaches.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":364077,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7572","titleShort":"Litigation Drafting","titleLong":"Litigation Drafting","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18156,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:25PM","timeEnd":"05:55PM","startDt":"08/24/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lgf28","firstName":"Lara","middleName":"G.","lastName":"Freed"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 276","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH276","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/24/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course focuses on drafting documents typically encountered during the pretrial phase of civil litigation.

In the context of Constitutional interpretation we will pay close attention to the rationale of constitutionalism, how it bears on constitutional interpretation, and how it explains the various ideological disputes between justices of the supreme court about the grounds and the legitimacy of their constitutional decisions. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":362299,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7785","titleShort":"War Crimes Trials and the Law","titleLong":"War Crimes Trials and the Law of Genocide","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":18172,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/24/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mzr3","firstName":"Menachem","middleName":"Z.","lastName":"Rosensaft"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 277","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH277","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/24/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Beginning in November 1945, in an unprecedented attempt to bring war criminals to justice, more than 20 senior government officials and military leaders of Hitlerʼs Third Reich were indicted and tried, in what has become known as the Nuremberg Trial, for crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Earlier that fall, the SS commandants, officers and guards who had been arrested by the British upon the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, had been tried before a British military tribunal. These were the first of numerous trials of Nazi war criminals and related criminal and civil proceedings arising out of the Holocaust. This seminar will examine legal and ethical issues raised in these and other trials of Nazi war criminals and individuals accused of collaborating with the Nazis in perpetrating crimes against humanity, including the 1947 \"Justice Trial\" of Nazi judges and senior officials of the Third Reich Ministry of Justice, the Eichmann Trial in Jerusalem and the 1963-64 Tel Aviv trial of Hersz Barenblat, the head of the Jewish police in the ghetto of Bedzin, Poland. The course will also examine the history of the Genocide Convention, and the developing law of genocide and crimes against humanity with respect to atrocities in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Darfur, including the evolving law on rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the professional responsibility writing requirement and the writing requirement.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":362859,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7832","titleShort":"Externship - Full Time","titleLong":"Externship - Full Time","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"CLN","ssrComponentLong":"Clinical","section":"301","classNbr":18237,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"08/24/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"chf54","firstName":"Catherine","middleName":"H","lastName":"Finn"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/24/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":12,"unitsMaximum":12,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["CLN"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The Externship - Full Time course allows students (24 in fall, 16 in spring) to earn 12 credit hours as externs working full time at approved placement sites at virtually any location (most sites are non-profit organizations or governmental agencies) during the fall or spring semester of their third year or the spring semester of their second year.

Working with the new clinic's community partners, Farmworker Legal Assistance Clinic I student attorneys will handle immigration and employment matters on behalf of farmworkers in the region, work that will typically involve negotiation and often require litigation. Students will also work in brief advice and referral outreach sessions in farmworker communities. Clinic participants may also have the opportunity to work on research and writing projects with civil rights, environmental protection, and farmworker rights organizations. Farmworker Clinic students will participate in a lawyering seminar and work with a clinic partner on their assigned cases. The lawyering seminar will focus on skills students need for effective client representation. Students will develop key lawyering skills, including interviewing, counseling, fact investigation, drafting, negotiation, language accessible practice, and, in some cases, trial advocacy.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-CEL)","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":367668,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7859","titleShort":"Farmworker Leg.

The Colloquium is designed to prepare the students to engage in doctoral-level research, analysis and writing, especially in comparative and international contexts. How is the researcher to select an object or subject of investigation? How should she formulate research questions? How should she engage in the study of foreign and domestic legal institutions, doctrines and/or cultures? How is interdisciplinary work to be accomplished?\nThe early portions of the course will involve discussing readings in comparative research methodology, including functionalism, Common Core analysis, legal transplant theory, historicism, law and development, legal pluralism, cultural analysis, colonial studies, and comparative institutionalism. In the latter portions of the course, students will present and critique their methodologically reflective research projects. A modest number of external speakers will be invited to present their work in progress for the purposes of generating methodologically oriented discussion.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"This seminar course will be required for all first-year J.S.D. candidates.
