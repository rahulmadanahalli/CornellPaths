How can stories change our view of events?  This course will explore theoretical discussions about modern revolutions (Arendt, Kant, Marx) as well as cinematic and literary examples (Kleist, Porumboiu, Hensel, Wolf) to watch as language builds, disrupts, and rearranges social orders. Through critical engagement with these texts, we will investigate how power works in society and experiment with the potential of language to remake the worlds it names. Formal essay assignments will draw on textual analysis and critical discussion of course readings to help you practice effective academic writing and develop your own world-making writing skills.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"No knowledge of German is expected.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":355526,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"1109","titleShort":"FWS:From Fairy Tale To Uncanny","titleLong":"FWS:From Fairy Tale To Uncanny","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17379,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ep399","firstName":"Ekaterina","middleName":"","lastName":"Pirozhenko"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 348","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH348","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"FWS Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"102","classNbr":17507,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dbm93","firstName":"Douglas","middleName":"Brent","lastName":"McBride"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 122","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH122","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"FWS Session"}],"description":"How did bawdy tales of peasants using magic to climb the social ladder get transformed into moral lessons for children?  The answer lies in Romanticism and its appropriation of the imagination as a force for social transformation.  As Romantics edited older tales for juvenile consumption they wrote new ones for adults.  This new fiction created the matrix for modern pop genres like fantasy, science-fiction, murder mysteries, and gothic horror.  To understand this paradigm shift in modern culture, we will read, discuss, and write about a variety of texts the Romantics collected, composed, or inspired, including poetry and film, in addition to classic fairy tales and academic scholarship on the topic.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring.","catalogComments":"No knowledge of German is expected.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366851,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"1113","titleShort":"FWS: Participatory Culture","titleLong":"FWS: Participatory Culture","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17385,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"hrm43","firstName":"Hannah","middleName":"Ruth","lastName":"Mueller"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Balch Hall - Tatkon Ctr 3343","bldgDescr":"Balch Hall","facilityDescrshort":"BAL3343","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"FWS Session"}],"description":"The rise of online media in the late twentieth century has led to the formation of alternative public spheres, with new opportunities for active participation open to anyone with internet access and basic computer skills.

Their success is indicated by the interest prominent philosophers have taken in their work and the many musical settings their poetry has inspired.

contrast as well as convergence.  Discussions and writing exercises will focus on texts that created the discursive framework for critiquing society and culture today.  Our method will proceed from the premise that critical reading, thinking, and writing are inseparable moments in the same operation of critique.  The question that guides that method will be: Do alternative ways of thinking exist

Possible topics include migrant and minority cultures; privacy and data protection; environmental conservation and the challenge of climate change. Besides the one-week travel the course involves pre- and post-travel sessions on the Cornell campus. The first part of the course is devoted to analyzing different ways of defining culture, as well as related concepts of inter- and transculturality, based primarily but not exclusively on the work of cultural anthropologist Joana Breidenbach. In the second part we will apply these theoretical concepts to the chosen research topic as we explore local contexts during the travel to Germany. Our post-travel sessions will be devoted to interrogating the mechanism and reach of stereotypical categorization and cultural claims in addition to assessing the outcomes of the research we conducted on the collaborative project. The aim of the course is to foster awareness of cultural difference and local contexts, as well as the critical ability to describe and question the stereotypical assumptions that underpin cultural identity. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: GERST 2000 or above or equivalent.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 8 students (students in the Language House given preference).

on literature and film from the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with primary examples drawn from Germany, France and the United States-in relation to Turkey, Hungary, Tunisia, Iran, Nigeria, China, Mexico, and Japan-this course explores how creative arts rework the fabric of social life affected by migration.  Seminar-style discussion of assigned readings and viewings, with occasional lectures on other arts and regions.  Thematic units organized around key concepts such as borders and movement, ethnoscapes and citizenship, reading and viewing, labor and leisure, cityscapes and

actor in public spheres.  During those years, the Jewish intellectual becomes a privileged object of investigations, definitions and fantasies -- including anti-Semitic stereotypes -- for literature and popular culture, sociology and medicine or law, deeply shaping national mentalities and imagination.  A considerable iconography, from painting to political propaganda and illustrated magazines, sketches his real or invented profile.  As an incarnation of urbanity, mobility, extraterritoriality, textuality and rational thought, the Jewish intellectual turns out to be a mirror of modernity, eliciting a strong conservative rejection.  Lasting from the Dreyfus Affair to the Nazi burning of books in 1933, and focusing on three national contexts -- France, Germany and Italy -- the course tries to explore the history of this collective representation through its multiple expressions, both textual and visual.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with GERST 6231/HIST 6232/JWST 6230/ROMS

Yet since World War II, his influence, his reputation, and his fascination for scholars in a wide range of cultural and political disciplines has steadily grown.

We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork,

In spite of its highly controversial uses, the concept of \"European Civil War\" is probably the must useful in order to sum up such an \"age of  extremes\" in which wars have no rules: they become wars against civilians, politics makes groups into implacable enemies and an endemic violence deeply reshaped both cultures and collective imagination.

actor in public spheres.  During those years, the Jewish intellectual becomes a privileged object of investigations, definitions and fantasies -- including anti-Semitic stereotypes -- for literature and popular culture, sociology and medicine or law, deeply shaping national mentalities and imagination.  A considerable iconography, from painting to political propaganda and illustrated magazines, sketches his real or invented profile.  As an incarnation of urbanity, mobility, extraterritoriality, textuality and rational thought, the Jewish intellectual turns out to be a mirror of modernity, eliciting a strong conservative rejection.  Lasting from the Dreyfus Affair to the Nazi burning of books in 1933, and focusing on three national contexts -- France, Germany and Italy -- the course tries to explore the history of this collective representation through its multiple expressions, both textual and visual.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with GERST 4231/HIST 4232/JWST 4230/ROMS

Concentrating on novels ranging from the late 19th to the early 20th century, we will pay close attention to questions of narrative structure as well as temporal and spatial arrangements. Also including comparatist interests, the seminar will discuss the modern German novel within the European context; discuss generic differences (modern versus \"classic\"); examine theories of the novel and their relationship to contemporary representational concerns. Specific points of interest are: the status of self-reflection; philosophical interruptions; irony; montage; subjectivity and literary self-projection; literature and urbanity.  In order to evaluate the \"very\" modern, the class will also discuss two examples of contemporary fiction. Authors include: Rilke, Kafka, Döblin, Broch, Th. Mann, R. Walser, Nossack, Handke, Johnson, Bernhard, Goetz, Musil, Beckett.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"All texts will be read in translation.

Yet since World War II, his influence, his reputation, and his fascination for scholars in a wide range of cultural and political disciplines has steadily grown. He is seen as a bridging figure between German and Jewish studies, between materialist critique of culture and the submerged yet powerful voice of theology, between literary history and philosophy. We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":351387,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"7540","titleShort":"Independent Study","titleLong":"Independent Study","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":5587,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"pf239","firstName":"Paul","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Fleming"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: graduate students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":360404,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"7541","titleShort":"Colloquium","titleLong":"Colloquium","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":5588,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"05:00PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"pf239","firstName":"Paul","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Fleming"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 156","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH156","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":null,"catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"}]
