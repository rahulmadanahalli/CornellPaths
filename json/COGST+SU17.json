Instead, an objective, deliberated, and multidisciplinary approach is necessary.  To that end, cognitive science draws on, and integrates, at least five disciplines: Psychology, Neuroscience, Computer Science, Linguistics, and Philosophy.  This course provides an introduction to the insights that these disciplines offer cognitive science while introducing students to current understanding of attention, memory, visual perception, learning, problem solving, language comprehension, and consciousness. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(KCM-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring, summer (six-week session).","catalogComments":"A 1 credit Writing in the Majors sections is available, COGST 1104.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2664,"crseId":351496,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"COGST","catalogNbr":"1111","titleShort":"Making a Difference by Design","titleLong":"Making a Difference by Design","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1134,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:00AM","timeEnd":"11:15AM","startDt":"06/26/2017","endDt":"08/04/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.
