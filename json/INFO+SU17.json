Using theories and research in moral philosophy and psychology, we examine how people perceive and reason about ethical issues presented by media and technology, and how moral action is influenced by cognitive, emotional, and ethical belief systems. Issues of autonomy, transparency, harm, privacy, manipulation, justice, democracy, equality, and care are discussed. We analyze the consistency between personal and professional ethics, the importance of moral character and agency, and the translation of moral thought to ethical action, and address the development of professional and personal ethical codes of conduct and research for communication professionals in the areas of new media and technology.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AG, CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Increase awareness of moral and ethical issues in media, technology, and communication.","Understand moral psychology and ethical principles.","Examine moral reasoning and ethical responsibilities—both personal and professional—that affect people and society.","Examine issues and implications of ethical relativism and ethical principles.","Reason thoughtfully and ethically about current cases and news items in communication, media, and technology."],"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"EN"}]
