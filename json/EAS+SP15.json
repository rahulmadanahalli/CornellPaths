Water in general and groundwater in specific is an important source of drinking water that we need to conserve for future generations. In this course, you will learn how to apply theory of groundwater flow and contaminant transport to real world groundwater pollution problems, simplifying the problem in such a way that it is easily solvable. The focus of many hydrology courses is theory, and deriving analytical equations. This is not the case in Introduction to groundwater. Although the theory is important, a good engineer knows the answer to a problem beforehand and then finds ways to calculate the solution. We will practice this by putting conceptual, analytical and simulation models in the broader context of past, current, and potential future groundwater quantity and quality issues triggered by natural, human, or combined actions.This elective course is intended for seniors and graduate students interested in environmental processes, and essential for those wanting to learn how to use their knowledge to solve real world problems.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(PBS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Field trip.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: fluid mechanics or hydrology course.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering.","A knowledge of contemporary issues.","An ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice for engineering practice."],"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"EN"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":355188,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"EAS","catalogNbr":"4750","titleShort":"Special Topics in Oceanography","titleLong":"Special Topics in Oceanography","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17523,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"chg2","firstName":"Charles","middleName":"H.","lastName":"Greene"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Enrollment limited to: students enrolled in the Ocean Biodiversity Research Apprenticeship program.
