The vision for this integration is the ability to create and analyze complete parametric representations of complex products and systems. These systems make it possible to investigate the impact of changing one aspect of a design on all other aspects of design and performance.

Discrete choice models represent the cognitive process of economic decisions and are widely used in transportation analysis, applied economics, marketing, and urban planning. Discrete choice analysis is used to forecast demand under differing pricing and marketing strategies and to determine how much consumers are willing to pay for qualitative improvements. In transportation engineering, these models allow researchers, firms, and policy-makers to predict demand for new alternatives and infrastructure (e.g. a light rail or a new highway), to analyze the market impact of firm decisions (e.g. merger of two airline companies), to set pricing strategies (e.g. road pricing, toll definition, revenue management), to prioritize research and development decisions (e.g. ultra low emission vehicles) as well as to perform cost-benefit analyses of transportation projects (e.g. building a new bridge).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: CEE 3040 and MATH 2940.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"EN"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":365491,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"CEE","catalogNbr":"6667","titleShort":"Transportation Energy Sys Mod","titleLong":"Transportation Energy Systems Module","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17928,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"11/03/2015","endDt":"12/01/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ra477","firstName":"Ricardo","middleName":"","lastName":"Daziano"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Olin Hall 255","bldgDescr":"Olin Hall","facilityDescrshort":"OLH255","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/01/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"CHEME","catalogNbr":"6667","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Energy technology module of CHEME 6660 covering transportation energy systems.
