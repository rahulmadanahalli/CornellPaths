This course considers development as an evolving world project and from the perspective of its social and ecological impact: asking questions about costs and benefits of economic growth, about the global context (geo-political, institutional, production, consumption, and discursive relations), and the sustainability of various models. We relate development trends in the South/Third World with those in the North/First World. We also examine shared, global issues, such as the environment, human rights, security, and their condition in different parts of the world. In examining development historically, we encourage students to situate trends shaping the twenty-first century world, and how they can contribute, as global citizens, to the ongoing debate about how to reformulate development as an inclusive an empowering social process.\nThis course combines Lectures with discussion, and uses films and section discussions to promote reflection on diversity of cultures and understandings of human development. It also includes a special component (access by instructor permission), in conjunction with Cornell's Writing in the Majors Program. This is worth an additional credit hour, and is for advanced students. These students will meet additionally in weekly Sections with a Writing Instructor from Development Sociology for a special topic focus to enhance understanding of course material as well as writing skills.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA) (HA) (D)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-SBY)","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Discuss the history of development.","Situate trends shaping the twenty-first century world, and how they can contribute, as global citizens, to the ongoing debate about how to reformulate development as an inclusive an empowering social process."],"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG"},{"strm":2629,"crseId":354444,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"DSOC","catalogNbr":"2750","titleShort":"Immigration & Changing America","titleLong":"Immigration and a Changing America","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1407,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"06/13/2016","endDt":"08/05/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"kjs256","firstName":"Kathleen","middleName":"Jean Delores","lastName":"Sexsmith"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Online Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

However, immigrants' choices about where to live, and the policies that shape their everyday lives, are changing rapidly. How do today's immigration patterns diverge from historical trends? How well are the new immigrants integrating in the economy and society? How do socially constructed categories like \"high skilled\" vs \"low skilled\", or \"legal immigrant\" vs \"illegal alien\", impact immigrant incorporation and well-being? And what happens to those whom the government decides do not belong?
