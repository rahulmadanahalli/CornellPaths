Second part of the course will concentrate on the functionality of major mammalian systems, such as cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematopoietic, and nervous. We will discuss certain common diseases, such as metabolic syndrome, cancer, and neurodegeneration from cell biology point of view, as well as current treatment strategies. We will discuss the physiological consequences of the trends of modern life, such as increasingly sedentary life-style, high calorie intake, and increase of the population age.
