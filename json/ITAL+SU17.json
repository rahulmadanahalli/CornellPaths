Topics include examination of the ways in which class relates to social and public space and urban space as performance. Additional course work in film production, performance, and writing allows students to re-inscribe their spatial/corporeal experiences into an alternative exhibition space of the city street or the written page. In addition, each student will be required to produce formal textual documentation and full textual analyses of this process and final performance, installation, or text-based product.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"}]
