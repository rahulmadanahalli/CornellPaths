Primary aim is to develop a mental map of the history of Latin America - of prominent themes issues; of historical eras and trajectories. Given the vastness of Latin America, and its somewhat arbitrary composition as an object of study, the approach of the course is thematic and chronological rather than regional. We will pay attention to a number of more specific and interconnected themes: the development of, and relationship between, economies and processes of state formation; the complex roles Britain and the U.S. have played in the region, but always with an appreciation for how Latin Americans have shaped their own histories and those of the U.S. and Britain; the ways in which non-elites - slaves, workers, peasants, among others - have shaped history; the politics of the production of history; and Latin America's 'situatedness' in a broader world.

What is it good for?  A political philosophy and approach to social organization that arose simultaneous with other grand  \"–isms,\" anarchism, perhaps more than any other idea and practice, has been condensed down by its critics and observers into a vague set of often contradictory caricatures. Is 'it' characterized by bohemian communities of nihilists, their rebellion culturally innovative but politically impotent, book-ended by Friedrich Nietzsche and Johnny Rotten?  Or is 'it' individualist libertarians who walk in the ideological footsteps of Murray Rothbard and Ayn Rand? Or collectivist anti-capitalists who tread the paths blazed by  Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin? Or, most famously, is 'it' a murky underworld of conspiratorial bomb throwers, held together less by bonds of solidarity than by a commitment to violence?  This seminar provides some relief from such limited and constraining perspectives by taking anarchism seriously as a social and political practice and tradition, one rooted largely in the left-wing critique of both the state and capitalism.","catalogBreadth":"(HA-AS)","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":359454,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"LATA","catalogNbr":"2150","titleShort":"Contemporary Lat Am Survey","titleLong":"Contemporary Latin American Survey","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":5310,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":9,"netid":"gym4","firstName":"Geraldine","middleName":"Yvonne","lastName":"Monterroso"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall G20","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSHG20","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Prerequisites: SPAN 2070 or 2090 or CASE Q+, or permission of instructor.

Sugar is different. Not only is sugar cane a relatively recent transplant, originating in Melanesia and South Asia, taken to the Middle East, and then cultivated extensively in the tropical regions of plantation America beginning in the 17th century. The sugar that it produces began as a luxury commodity and gradually became a household staple over the course of three centuries. This course examines key aspects of the transformation of sugar cane from plant to luxury commodity and then to staple, with particular emphasis on the impact that its cultivation and manufacturing had on the ecology, demography, diet, history, culture, economies, and politics of the Caribbean Basin. Sugar manufacturing in this region generated the enormous wealth that slave and indentured labor produced in and for transatlantic commerce for the three centuries that gave rise to the modern, western world. Given the importance of sugar at the time, sugar plantations were sites of some of the most ambitious experiments in science, industry, labor, and trade that the world had ever seen.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":365298,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"LATA","catalogNbr":"3065","titleShort":"Immigrant America","titleLong":"Immigrant America: Race and Citizenship in Modern Working-Class History","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":8648,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"vm248","firstName":"Veronica","middleName":"","lastName":"Martinez-Matsuda"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 105","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS105","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3065","type":"C"},{"subject":"ILRLR","catalogNbr":"3065","type":"C"},{"subject":"LSP","catalogNbr":"3065","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Immigration discourse and policy has played a central role in shaping the modern American nation-state, including its composition, values, and institutions.

As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective. We will also address questions regarding the perceived benefit and cost of immigration at both the national and local (i.e., community) levels. In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time. Finally, we will consider how immigrants have negotiated the pressures of their new surroundings, and challenged dominant conceptions of American national identity and citizenship in the process.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":357766,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"LATA","catalogNbr":"3256","titleShort":"Ancient
