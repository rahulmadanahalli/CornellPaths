They all have in common the intention of transcending a worldview that is exclusively premised on human needs and measures. Thus, posthumanist theorizing in the widest sense includes many recent additions to the critical canon, such as eco-criticism and animal studies. It is the underlying hypothesis of this course that much posthumanist thinking is recapitulatingâconsciously or unconsciouslyâmany of the insights of cybernetics and systems theory, and that tracking this genealogy helps in clarifying the stakes and challenges of posthumanist theory.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Taught in English.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: graduate students only or instructor permission.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":369643,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"6515","titleShort":"Weimar & Nazi Germany","titleLong":"Culture of Weimar and Nazi Germany","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16936,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"pcm29","firstName":"Patrizia","middleName":"C.","lastName":"McBride"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Olin Library 403","bldgDescr":"Olin Library","facilityDescrshort":"OLL403","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Anchor Course.
