The course includes two parts. In the first part, students develop a set of core skills essential to financial statement analysis. We cover strategic ratio analysis, cash flow analysis, forecasting, proforma financial statements, and firm valuation using discounted cash flow and residual income techniques. The second part focuses on more advanced financial statement topics and specialized industries.

International finance is different in two basic respects: (1) the existence of multiple currencies adds risk to investment and financing decisions; (2) when corporations and portfolio investors cross international borders, both problems and opportunities arise. This course focuses on these issues and highlights how finance theory can be extended to address them. Students apply the basic principles of international finance to a variety of problems. The course helps students understand the ideas and research results of international finance and adapt what they learn to the practical problems in the increasingly globalized business world. The first part of the course outlines exchange rate volatility, barriers to international capital flows, and the value of international diversification. The second part presents a variety of problems, examples, and applications from the three basic themes described in part one. Spreadsheet assignments and a term project requiring data analysis develop research skills and illustrate academic concepts. Exams consist of computational, short answer, and short essay questions.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: NCC 5060 or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":350245,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"5550","titleShort":"Fixed Inc &Int Rate Der","titleLong":"Fixed Income Securities and Interest Rate Options","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13817,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"raj15","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Jarrow"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B09","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB09","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***JOHNSON SCHOOL AND GRADUATE STUDENTS ONLY***.

The projects are done by teams of students, typically four to five, supported by both the faculty and an experienced adviser. Lecture material covers the approach to structuring complex problems, conducting analytical work and developing conclusions and recommendations. Student teams are expected to communicate regularly with their clients and to have at least one interim and final presentations. These experiential-learning projects will integrate the concepts and knowledge covered in the core courses and immersions as well as other fall electives. These client-critical projects typically incorporate the broad areas of strategy, operations, finance or marketing.

Unlike traditional finance theories, behavioral finance argues that some financial market phenomena can plausibly be understood only under the assumption that some market participants are not fully rational.

Topics include: (1) investor psychological bias and irrational trading behavior, and how to overcome our own biases in stock trading; (2) limits of arbitrage and the risk of leveraged convergence trading; (3) stock index market timing (and why market timing is far more important in emerging markets around the world than in the US); (4) typical behavioral finance approaches in constructing outperforming stock portfolios (including value, momentum, size, earnings quality, corporate governance, effects of short-sale constraint, and many other effects); (5) applying behavioral finance concepts to understanding China's stock market (as an example of emerging equity markets).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":365543,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6029","titleShort":"NYC Technology Trek","titleLong":"NYC Technology Trek","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18401,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:30PM","timeEnd":"09:00PM","startDt":"10/09/2015","endDt":"10/09/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"wds4","firstName":"Wesley","middleName":"","lastName":"Sine"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"08:00AM","timeEnd":"11:59PM","startDt":"10/10/2015","endDt":"10/10/2015","instructors":[],"pattern":"S","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":3,"timeStart":"12:00AM","timeEnd":"05:00PM","startDt":"10/11/2015","endDt":"10/11/2015","instructors":[],"pattern":"Su","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"By Permisson Only.

What special challenges face women as they transition from students to managers to leaders? What do the latest research findings offer to women who are seeking C-level positions and the organizations that want to benefit from more women leaders? In this course, we will take a multi-pronged approach to learning about women and leadership to better prepare students of both genders to lead in organizations that are now comprised of nearly 50% women. To do this we will analyze case studies of women leaders pulled from a range of industries. We will review the current state of empirical evidence about the status of women as leaders, investigate the barriers that have made it more difficult for women to reach the top of the business world, and consider ways in which individuals and organizations can overcome them. Guest speakers will share their experiences with the class. Finally, there will be time to engage in deep reflection about what students expect from their careers, as well as a chance to consider the pathways they must take to become effective and inclusive leaders in increasingly diverse organizations.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":364727,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6170","titleShort":"Emerging Technology Markets","titleLong":"Emerging Technology Markets","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17747,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"10/12/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rll36","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"Louis","lastName":"Laperle"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B09","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB09","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"** S/U or Letter Grade Only - NO AUDITS ALLOWED **\nDeadline to Change Grading Option:  October 27th \nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students: August 10th thru September 8th with an additional Add/Drop period beginning October 14th at 8:00am to October 20th at 4:00pm. \nNon-Johnson Students:  October 19th at 8:00am to October 20th 4:00pm.

Through discussion and demonstration, students will be exposed to various consumer behavior phenomena and will be encouraged to understand consumers' wants and needs by putting themselves in the consumers' shoes. During this process, students will become knowledgeable of how understanding consumer psychology can be used to develop powerful marketing strategies and tactics. This knowledge can, in turn, lead to a development of an important competitive advantage: an ability to see how to impact consumers, and hence, a talent for making more insightful business decisions. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":362523,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6290","titleShort":"Current Topics in Marketing","titleLong":"Current Topics in Marketing","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15929,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"05:40PM","startDt":"10/12/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":7,"netid":"jer9","firstName":"J.","middleName":"","lastName":"Russo"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B09","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB09","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***JOHNSON STUDENTS ONLY***\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students August 10th thru September 8th with an additional Add/Drop period beginning October 14th at 8:00am to October 20th at 4:00pm. \r\nYou may add or drop a second-half class after October 20th with permission of the faculty.

The course focuses on three themes: (1) the source, discovery, and evaluation of technological opportunities on a university campus; (2) increasing the efficiency of the innovation process to produce new technologies that satisfy customer needs; and (3) the different mechanisms available to appropriate returns from technology. The course uses readings, cases, and discussions with practitioners to examine this phenomenon. After completing this class, students will be familiar with basic principles related to technology entrepreneurship and will have gained a deeper understanding of the technology commercialization process at Cornell.

In general, an organization cannot survive without the trust of numerous stakeholders, and ethical lapses destroy trust and threaten vital stakeholder relationships. In today's volatile and fiercely competitive business environment, a manager must be able to identify and effectively resolve ethical issues that inevitably arise in the pursuit of business (and career) objectives. This course is designed to enhance students' skills in moral reasoning as it applies to managerial decision making. It begins by examining normative concepts and principles that typically enter into moral reasoning, then uses those concepts and principles to analyze cases. Discussions are designed to help students understand the moral issues confronting the decision makers in the cases and explore how those issues might be addressed in ethically responsible ways.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":350704,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6730","titleShort":"Derivatives Securities Part I","titleLong":"Derivatives Securities Part I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15821,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"10/11/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":13,"netid":"dh634","firstName":"Darien","middleName":"","lastName":"Huang"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***GM, GRAD and UG SRS/JRS ONLY***.  \r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students: August 10th at 8:00am to September 8th at 4:00pm.

This course provides an introduction to basic derivatives such as futures, swaps, and options. We deal with the issue of pricing derivative securities by simple arbitrage arguments, and develop a framework for analyzing and using financial derivatives in various applications. By the end of the course, you should have a good understanding of commonly used derivatives in practice. Although the study of financial instruments is inherently quantitative, we focus on economic intuitions and interpretations behind derivative securities while keeping mathematic derivations minimal.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: NCC 5060 or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":350711,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6740","titleShort":"Derivatives Securities Part II","titleLong":"Derivatives Securities Part II","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15918,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"10/12/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":13,"netid":"dh634","firstName":"Darien","middleName":"","lastName":"Huang"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B01","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***GM, GRAD and UG SRS/JRS ONLY***.\r\nAdd/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students August 10th thru September 8th with an additional Add/Drop period beginning October 14th at 8:00am to October 20th at 4:00pm. \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  October 19th at 8:00am to October 20th 4:00pm.

In particular, the course will focus on the legal issues typically encountered by private companies at formation, financing, operation and key corporate events, including acquisition transactions and public offerings. Topics covered will include corporate formation and governance, angel investments (both equity and debt), venture capital financing, employment and equity compensation matters, protection of intellectual property, securities laws compliance, venture debt financing and exit strategies through merger, acquisition or initial public offering. The course will offer an introduction to these topics through the eyes of attorneys who practice in a leading Silicon Valley-based law firm active in New York City's technology market and may also include guest presentations by industry participants, such as venture capitalists, angel investors and entrepreneurs.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":366023,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6970","titleShort":"Private Equity Playbook","titleLong":"Private Equity Playbook","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18654,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:40PM","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"fjb26","firstName":"Franci","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Blassberg"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 285","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH285","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6298","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course will examine the private equity industry by exploring the many roles that lawyers and business professionals can play in the private equity marketplace.
