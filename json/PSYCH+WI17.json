Each individual's personality is the culmination of his or her genetic makeup, biology, early life experiences, learning and culture. In this undergraduate-level course, we will review the major theories and research paradigms (e.g., trait, biological, cognitive) of modern-day personality psychology. The course will emphasize contemporary research, theory, and methodology, as well as provide a review of historical accounts that have significantly contributed to current conceptualizations.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, summer (three-week session).","catalogComments":"Introductory courses in social and personality psychology.
