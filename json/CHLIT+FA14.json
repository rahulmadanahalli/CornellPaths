Students will read essays on translation in both English and Chinese, and then put theory into practice by producing original translations of essays, poems, or short fiction. This process will teach translation as a craft, but it is also intended for students who want to read deeply and carefully, as good translators must. Prior experience with or specialization in Chinese literature is not required. By the end of the semester, each student will produce a complete translation of a previously untranslated literary work, which will be discussed and revised by the practicum as a whole.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: CHIN 4412 or CHIN 2210 or graduate student standing with knowledge of Chinese language.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"(LL)","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":351076,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"CHLIT","catalogNbr":"4421","titleShort":"Directed Study","titleLong":"Directed Study","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":5847,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Students choose a faculty member to oversee this independent study.
