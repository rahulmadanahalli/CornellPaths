This graduate seminar examines the theoretical and practical linkages between \"community\" and \"place\" and applies them to contemporary environmental problems. \"Community\" and \"place,\" though often invoked, are rarely critically examined, hence the course seeks to clarify the ways in which the two concepts have been conceptualized and operationalized by sociology and related disciplines. Each in turn is critically applied to the analysis of a range of contemporary environmental issues.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-SBY)","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: graduate students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Critically examine the nature society interrelationships.","Apply social science  theory to examine  interrelationships between environmental issues and changes in social structure.","Build analytical frameworks to design original research on interrelationships between environmental change and local social organization.","Formulate alternative policy formulations to mediate environmental problems at the local level."],"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AG","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":365337,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NTRES","catalogNbr":"6330","titleShort":"Indigenous&Based Eco Knowledg","titleLong":"Ways of Knowing: Indigenous and Place-Based Ecological Knowledge","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":4520,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"ksk28","firstName":"Karim-Aly","middleName":"Saleh","lastName":"Kassam"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Fernow Hall G24","bldgDescr":"Fernow Hall","facilityDescrshort":"FRNG24","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AIS","catalogNbr":"3330","type":"B"},{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3330","type":"B"},{"subject":"NTRES","catalogNbr":"3330","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Based on indigenous and place-based \"ways of knowing,\" this course (1) presents a theoretical and humanistic framework from which to understand generation of ecological knowledge; (2) examines processes by which to engage indigenous and place-based knowledge of natural resources, the nonhuman environment, and human-environment interactions; and (3) reflects upon the relevance of this knowledge to climatic change, resource extraction, food sovereignty, medicinal plant biodiversity, and issues of sustainability and conservation.

Students will communicate directly with practitioners in Ecuador during the Fall semester and develop projects with their practitioners.

The first part of the course introduces students to the long, but often overlooked, history of environmental city development in the western planning tradition. The second part of the course reviews present-day efforts to apply these approaches in the face of modern metropolitan challenges to creating ecologically responsible cities.

Academic Session"}],"description":"Environmental governance is defined as the assemblage of institutions that regulate society-nature interactions and shape environmental outcomes across a range of spatial and temporal scales.  Institutions, broadly defined, are mechanisms of social coordination including laws (formal) and social norms (informal) that guide the behavior of individuals.  Participants in the course will explore the roles of governments, markets, and collective action in environmental management and mismanagement. We will emphasize interactions among leading environmental policy strategies: public regulation, market-based incentives, and community-based resource management. The course is focused around a set of analytic perspectives.  These theoretical frameworks allow us to synthesize empirical observations and material changes in ways that inform our understanding of contemporary evolution of environmental policy and management.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AG)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-SBY)","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Students will gain familiarity with the concepts, theories and applications of institutional analysis applied to environment.","Students will develop critical awareness of the strengths and weakness of states, markets and collective structures as resources for social regulation.","Students will develop an historical appreciation of environmental policy in order to reflect critically on contemporary status and trends.","Students will develop an interdisciplinary understanding of environmental policy through exploration of economic, sociological and political scientific perspectives.","Students will be exposed to a broad range of environmental problems and policy and management responses.

Metropolitan transformation is explored in conjunction with alternative transportation, renewable energy, green infrastructure, recycling and resource management, and sustainable economics as means toward advancing cities to become the basis of an ecologically sound and socially just society. The first part of the course introduces students to the long, but often overlooked, history of environmental city development in the western planning tradition. The second part of the course reviews present-day efforts to apply these approaches in the face of modern metropolitan challenges to creating ecologically responsible cities.
