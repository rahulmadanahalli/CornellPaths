This course surveys the legal and social issues that arise in the administration of the death penalty. The reading will be largely comprised of reported death penalty cases, but will be augmented by a variety of other sources, including empirical studies of the death penalty and the litigation experience of the professors. Although the focus will be on capital punishment as practiced in the United States, we will also consider international and comparative perspectives. Guest speakers will provide a range of views, and law students with experience working on capital cases will lead discussion sections.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: undergraduates only.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368221,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"4071","titleShort":"Law Culture and Society China","titleLong":"Law Culture and Society in China","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16369,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"xy64","firstName":"Xingzhong","middleName":"","lastName":"Yu"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 279","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH279","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"CAPS","catalogNbr":"4071","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"What are the main obstacles on China's road towards the Rule of Law?

course designed to introduce first-year students to lawyering skills, with primary emphasis on legal writing, analysis, research, and oral presentations. Assignments are usually set in the context of a simulated law office (or judge's chambers). In the fall semester, students write predictive memoranda that point out the strengths and weaknesses of their client's case. To prepare the memoranda, students may need to determine the facts of the case by conducting interviews or depositions. Acting as junior attorneys, students will also make an oral presentation to a supervising attorney. The spring semester focuses on persuasive advocacy. Students prepare a memorandum, motion, or brief for submission to a court and, later, orally argue for their positions in a simulated court session. Throughout the year, students also learn the fundamentals of legal research. Instruction occurs not only in full-class sessions but also in individual conferences.

Indeed, many cases are lost, won, or settled because of information gleaned at a deposition. Attorneys also often modify trial strategies because of a witness's performance at a deposition. Because depositions play such an important role in litigation, the majority of junior litigation attorneys can expect to deal with depositions in some manner from the very start of their careers. This introductory course will expose students to several facets of a deposition: preparing for deposition, asking questions at a deposition, defending the witness at a deposition, using documents at a deposition, and reviewing the transcript of a deposition. Students can expect to take and defend mock depositions and to observe and critique their fellow students' deposition skills.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"Forbidden Overlap: students who have already taken Pretrial Discovery: Depositions (two-credit class) or Deposition Skills (one-credit class) may not enroll in this class.","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Satisfies the skills requirement.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368698,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6573","titleShort":"TECH: Privacy and Security","titleLong":"TECH: Internet Privacy and Cybersecurity","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18303,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:45AM","timeEnd":"12:15PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ftw6","firstName":"Felix","middleName":"Tien-Shang","lastName":"Wu"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall 389","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTH389","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This course is streamed from the NYC Tech campus."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"DW","instrModeDescrshort":"DL WWW","instrModeDescr":"Distance Learning - WWW","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6568","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":null,"catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368424,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6614","titleShort":"Law Team","titleLong":"Law Team","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"030","classNbr":18535,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ckw26","firstName":"Charles","middleName":"K.","lastName":"Whitehead"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This class is for LLM-TECH students only and is taught in NYC."}],"campus":"NYT","campusDescr":"New York Tech Campus","location":"NYCTECH","locationDescr":"Cornell Tech","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"One or more students will be paired with a lawyer and/or law firm with substantial experience in technology and high-growth corporate transactions.

The loftier aim, by contrast, is to investigate the many ways in which one's professional responsibilities might conflict with one's personal obligations, self-interest or moral ideals. What should a lawyer do when her professional duties conflict with her financial interests, obligations to friends or family, or her religious beliefs? Why might it be justified for a lawyer to defend a client she knows to be guilty? Is it an excuse that one was \"just following orders\"? We will investigate such questions by reading relevant legal opinions, as well as work by legal academics and moral philosophers. Students will take several smaller exams to test their mastery of central ethical rules governing the conduct of lawyers, and complete short writing assignments on the theoretical questions discussed in class.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":351622,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6791","titleShort":"Public International Law","titleLong":"Public International Law","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16035,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:10PM","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jdo43","firstName":"Jens","middleName":"David","lastName":"Ohlin"}],"pattern":"MTW","facilityDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall G90","bldgDescr":"Myron Taylor Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MTHG90","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"An introduction to the legal rules governing the conduct of states vis-à-vis other states, individuals, and international organizations, with reference to major current events and issues.

Topics will include state constitutions, the rights that they confer, and their methods of interpretation; local government boundary formation and boundary change; state and local service, police, and taxing powers; the emergence of supra-local (regional) government; and the place of state and local governments in the federal system (including commerce clause, privileges and immunities clause, and taxation issues).

In addition to readings excerpts from biographies and scholarly works, we will also use primary materials from online sources such as the Civil Rights Digital Library, as well as documentary films.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Attendance at the first meeting is required.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368462,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7253","titleShort":"Corporate Citzens","titleLong":"Faculty At Home Seminar: Corporate Citizens","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16078,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"06:30PM","timeEnd":"08:30PM","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lms76","firstName":"Laura","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Spitz"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/23/2017","endDt":"04/28/2017","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":null,"catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368464,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7254","titleShort":"Right to Adeq.

We will examine, for example, debates about voting, trial procedure, the prison system, citizenship, and other aspects of democratic process. After the introductory sessions, the remainder of the course will be organized around a series of speakers, some drawn from Cornell and some from other universities.

A central theme will be the question whether and to what degree welfare, well-being, and wealth for that matter can be understood apart from and even as determinative of normative propriety (\"rightness\" and \"wrongness\"), or whether instead these concepts presuppose a prior conception of normative propriety.

The students' best skills will be put to practice while they work towards creating an atmosphere of trust and comfort for their clients and learning the essentials of establishing solid attorney-client relationships. Specifically, students will be working in pairs under supervision of faculty to prepare an actual estate plan for the client which includes a last will and testament, a living will, a health care proxy and a power of attorney along with the statutory major gifts rider (if applicable). Students will take part in the entire estate planning process from the initial informational intake meeting, to the preparation of the client's estate planning documents, to discussing the drafts with the clients along with addressing their comments and changes and to preparing and assisting with the execution of the client's estate planning documents. To further enhance the learning experience, lectures will be provided on the fundamentals of estate planning from establishing a healthy attorney-client relationship, drafting considerations for the client's last will and testament, basic related estate and income tax issues, ethical issues and the administration of the client's estate upon death. The classroom component of the course ensures that students understand not only the legal issues but also the practical and human issues involved in a trusts and estates practice.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368786,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7844","titleShort":"Estate

Students who wish to apply to the clinic should submit a resume, transcript, and short statement of interest (no more than two pages) to Prof. Lyon. For more information about the clinic, email Prof. Lyon (beth.lyon@cornell.edu) and schedule a meeting. This course requires off premises travel to meet with clients and participate in hearings. Employment on a farm is one of the worlds' most difficult and dangerous occupations. Farmworkers experience geographic, linguistic, and cultural isolation, separation from family, immigration insecurity reinforced by policing practices, workplace sexual violence, and exclusion from protective employment laws. Working with the new clinic's community partners, Farmworker Legal Assistance Clinic I student attorneys will handle immigration and employment matters on behalf of farmworkers in the region, work that will typically involve negotiation and often require litigation. Students will also work in brief advice and referral outreach sessions in farmworker communities. Clinic participants may also have the opportunity to work on research and writing projects with civil rights, environmental protection, and farmworker rights organizations. Farmworker Clinic students will participate in a lawyering seminar and work with a clinic partner on their assigned cases. The lawyering seminar will focus on skills students need for effective client representation. Students will develop key lawyering skills, including interviewing, counseling, fact investigation, drafting, negotiation, language accessible practice, and, in some cases, trial advocacy.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-CEL)","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":367664,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"7858","titleShort":"Farmworker Leg.

There will also be an opportunity to attend hearings, trials, motion arguments, and pre-trial proceedings. New York Attorney General Clinic II (AG II) builds on skills and knowledge acquired by students in New York Attorney General Clinic I (AG I), with an emphasis in AG II on more complex legal matters, legal document drafting, working with attorneys in preparation for court proceedings, developing litigation defense strategies, and resolving professional responsibility issues.  The class will include discussion of legal and ethical issues seen in litigation, with special emphasis on matters assigned to students, and will also focus on specific types of practice issues seen in developing cases for dispositive motions or for trial.  Issues to be discussed include preparation of expert witnesses, understanding qualified immunity applicable to governmental actions, responding to discovery of privileged or confidential materials, valuing actions, and developing successful litigation strategies.  Types of matters that students could be assigned include defense of medical malpractice claims, defective highway design claims, 1983 civil rights actions, petitions seeking to overturn state agency determinations, prisoner claims and public advocacy litigation. Guest speakers will be attorneys serving in various capacities in State or Federal government and may include a judge or court attorney.
