Students are placed in a research laboratory with a designed project under the direct supervision of a research associate (upper-level graduate student, post-doc, or faculty member). Students are graded on preparation, participation in laboratory, academic life, and appropriate acquisition of techniques. At the end of the six-week session, they are expected to give a brief (15- to 20-minute) oral presentation on their work and submit a manuscript in a form suitable for publication. The faculty director of the laboratory has ultimate responsibility for evaluating each student's work and assigning the grade.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring, summer.","catalogComments":"Minimum 120 hours of lab time expected.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: one year of basic biology (score of 5 on Biology Advanced Placement Examination of College Entrance Examination Board or BIOG 1000 level) or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: undergraduate students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"VM"}]
