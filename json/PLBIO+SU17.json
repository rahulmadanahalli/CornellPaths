Genetically modified (GM) crops have been a hot topic with controversy. One of the major concerns is on the GM crops' safety when served as our food or food ingredients. The objective of this 1-credit modular course is to discuss the principles and nature of crop genetic engineering vs. conventional plant breeding, and to show case studies of genetically engineered food crops with emphases on how they are generated, how the nutritional values are improved, and how to detect or examine if one's food may be genetically engineered or may contain GM crop-derived ingredients.
