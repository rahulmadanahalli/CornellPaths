The class will expose students to a community that has rejected the prospect of open-pit mining, and instead attempted to create an alternative model of development focusing on artisan cooperatives, conservation initiatives, and sustainable agriculture. A series of guest lecturers from a wide range of disciplines will contextualize the case-study by addressing issues of sustainable development, community-based conservation, and resistance to extractive industries. Students will communicate directly with practitioners in Ecuador during the Fall semester and develop projects with their practitioners.

In fact in many water-short areas in the world, such as the Mediterranean, much of Sub-Saharan Africa, and India, it is already a main cause of the prevailing poverty. Management of water in water scarce regions demands tradeoffs between a wide range of goals: preservation or enhancement of the environment, enhancement of social equity, preservation of cultural identity, and economically efficient utilization of water. Water management also requires consideration of a wide range of factors, some physical other socio/cultural, economic, legal, and political. The end result is seldom perfect since the goals are often are in conflict with one another.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-SBY)","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: graduate standing or permission of instructors.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AG"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":354741,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"IARD","catalogNbr":"7830","titleShort":"Farmer-Centered Resrch & Ext.","titleLong":"Farmer-Centered Research and Extension","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":3881,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"twt2","firstName":"Terry","middleName":"W.","lastName":"Tucker"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Fernow Hall G01","bldgDescr":"Fernow Hall","facilityDescrshort":"FRNG01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"A comparative analysis of extension and research philosophies and educational approaches to sustainable agriculture and natural resource management using case studies from developing countries.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AG"}]
