Supported by lectures and discussions, students will work in small groups to examine real-world case studies of on-going ecoagriculture and conservation projects in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the United States using two new Internet-based learning systems (www.conservationbridge.org). Student teams will address complex interdisciplinary questions of sustainability by working collaboratively with an identified practitioner who is directly involved in the case study project being examined. This will ensure that classroom activities address actual constraints and problems being faced by local people associated with each case. Out-of-class work is expected and a final written team report and a class presentation are required. Students also will be expected to present a seminar discussing their past international experience(s).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: senior standing in IARD, SNES, or NTRES and international experience; others by permission of instructors.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Students will use all the skills they have accumulated from courses and international experiences to address complex real life issues related to sustainable ecoagriculture and will be linked to real life practitioners in the field."],"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":364809,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SNES","catalogNbr":"4940","titleShort":"Special Topics in SNES","titleLong":"Special Topics in Science of Natural and Environmental Systems","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":4239,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ph14","firstName":"Peter","middleName":"","lastName":"Hobbs"},{"instrAssignSeq":6,"netid":"jpl4","firstName":"James","middleName":"Philip","lastName":"Lassoie"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Enrollment limited to: senior standing in IARD, SNES, or NTRES and international experience; others by permission of instructors."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Senior Seminar in EcoAgricultr"}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The department teaches \"trial\" courses under this number.
