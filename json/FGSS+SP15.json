The institution was an important marker of adulthood, linking individuals and lineages in a network of mutual cooperation and support. Marriage practices and the concomitant gender expectations varied significantly between societies, and over time. As a result, marriage and divorce are especially rich terrain for exploring social history, women's agency, discursive constructions of 'women', masculinity and gender relations of power. This course explores some of the newest scholarship on marriage by Africanist scholars. The readings demonstrate the wide cultural variety in marriage as well as the dynamic relationship between marriage and historical change. They especially highlight women's roles and expectations in marriage, masculinity and the ways men and women negotiated the rules and boundaries of marriage.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":364557,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4339","titleShort":"Bodies at the Border","titleLong":"Bodies at the Border","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":8979,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ab425","firstName":"Anindita","middleName":"","lastName":"Banerjee"},{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"dac9","firstName":"Debra","middleName":"Ann","lastName":"Castillo"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 204","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH204","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Limited to 15 students."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"4440","type":"B"},{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"6640","type":"B"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4339","type":"B"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6339","type":"B"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"6339","type":"B"},{"subject":"LSP","catalogNbr":"4339","type":"B"},{"subject":"LSP","catalogNbr":"6339","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Although the wounded, often feminine, body is the most powerful way of imagining border space in both the Indian subcontinent and the Americas, it is seldom coupled with the embodied practices and performances through which borders define everyday life and shape geographical and historical consciousness in the two regions.

We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and marginalized female hip hop artists contest sexually exploitative images of women. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? Does hip hop allow a space for alternative femininities? The course will also address broader questions related to representations of Black femininity, minorities in the media, gender and sexual identity construction.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366741,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4403","titleShort":"Black Women Writers South","titleLong":"Black Women Writers of the South","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17219,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:00PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rdr83","firstName":"Riche","middleName":"D.","lastName":"Richardson"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Africana Ctr 111","bldgDescr":"Africana Ctr","facilityDescrshort":"AFC111","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"4403","type":"B"},{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"6403","type":"B"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"4603","type":"B"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"6403","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course considers the new generation of writers of black women that has emerged in the U.S. South in more recent years, whose writings have increasingly impacted the development of contemporary African American literature.

It incorporates theoretical literature and content that is broader than that of Southeast Asia.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with ASIAN 4416/FGSS 4160/HIST 4160/LGBT 4160.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":364918,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"6339","titleShort":"Bodies at the Border","titleLong":"Bodies at the Border","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":8982,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ab425","firstName":"Anindita","middleName":"","lastName":"Banerjee"},{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"dac9","firstName":"Debra","middleName":"Ann","lastName":"Castillo"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 204","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH204","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Limited to 15 students."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"4440","type":"B"},{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"6640","type":"B"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4339","type":"B"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6339","type":"B"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4339","type":"B"},{"subject":"LSP","catalogNbr":"4339","type":"B"},{"subject":"LSP","catalogNbr":"6339","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Although the wounded, often feminine, body is the most powerful way of imagining border space in both the Indian subcontinent and the Americas, it is seldom coupled with the embodied practices and performances through which borders define everyday life and shape geographical and historical consciousness in the two regions.

Genres that we will explore include the novel, poetry and essay and memoir. We will consider a range of authors, including Tayari Jones, Shay Youngblood, Honorée Jeffers, and Natasha Tretheway. Concomitantly, we will explore the visual art of Kara Walker. We will consider ways in which these writers build upon established themes and conventions in African American and black women's writing and the implications of their work for black feminist theory.   Furthermore, we will examine the impact of their work within the emergent field of twenty-first century African American literature and criticism.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366688,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"6472","titleShort":"The Problem with Rights","titleLong":"The Problem with Rights","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16804,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"car27","firstName":"Camille","middleName":"Alexandra","lastName":"Robcis"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"White Hall 104","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT104","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"6472","type":"C"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6472","type":"C"},{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"6776","type":"C"},{"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"6472","type":"C"},{"subject":"LGBT","catalogNbr":"6472","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"In June 2013, in the space of a week, the Supreme Court ruled on affirmative action, the legacy of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). While the first two decisions were perceived as a step back in the fight against racial discrimination, the repeal of DOMA was welcomed by mainstream LGBT-rights organizations as a decisive move towards equality. One of the goals of this seminar is to think these rulings together instead of treating them as separate entities. How did the struggle for sexual rights and the promotion of color blindness come to coexist so easily within the law? In order to understand how liberalism has operated historically and theoretically as a crucial site of regulation for sexuality and race, we will read texts from a wide range of contexts and disciplines including political theory, anthropology, literature, philosophy, history, and law. Readings will include \"classic\" critics of liberalism such as Marx, Nietzsche, Althusser, and Foucault, and contemporary authors such as Wendy Brown, Elizabeth Povinelli, Lisa Duggan, David Eng, Janet Halley, Katherine Franke, and Jasbir Puar, among others.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":355400,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"6580","titleShort":"Race & Gender-Asian Hist & Lit","titleLong":"Theorizing Gender and Race in Asian Histories and Literatures","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15937,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ns32","firstName":"Naoki","middleName":"","lastName":"Sakai"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 494","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH494","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"3388","type":"B"},{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"6688","type":"B"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"3980","type":"B"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6680","type":"B"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"3580","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"For a long time area studies have overlooked the questions of gender, race/ethnicity, and social class in fields related to East Asia and the trans-Pacific regions. Little attention has been paid to how to conceptualize gender and race/ethnicity; how to analyze the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and class essentialism (some call it \"class racism\"), and how to understand the relationships of these topics to the broader contexts of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism. This course is designed to offer a series of discussions about the following problems: (1) the historically specific modes of sexism and racism in social spaces related to Japan and other places in the trans-Pacific; (2) the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and social class in various contexts including those of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism; (3) the roles of gender, race, and social class in the United States' knowledge production about East Asia in general; and (4) the conceptions of gender and race in the social formations particular to East Asia.

Beginning with seminal historical cases, it moves to a focus on key questions regarding sexuality, embodiment, and desire and how these are linked to new modes of governance as well as to forms of belief in the contemporary public sphere. It brings Thai visual and print media materials into conversation with contemporary writing from feminist and queer theory, critical race studies, critiques of liberalism, Buddhist studies, visual studies, and affect theory. The course provides a rigorous introduction to critical approaches in gender and sexuality studies.
