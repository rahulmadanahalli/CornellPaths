The question of \"how we see\" is discussed in terms of (1) procedures of sight (from optical machines to the psychology of vision and the philosophy of aesthetics); (2) spaces of vision (from landscapes to maps to cities); (3) objects of vision (from sacred sites to illuminated books to digital art); and (4) performances of vision (race, sexualities, ethnicities, cultures). Of importance to the course is the practical and conceptual relation of 20th-century visual technologies (photography, cinema, video, and computing) to their historical corollaries in the arts. The course draws on the visual traditions of both Western and non-Western societies and study texts that have defined the premises and analytic vocabularies of the visual. Through viewings, screenings, collaborative writing, and art projects, students develop the critical skills necessary to appreciate how the approaches that define visual studies complicate traditional models of defining and analyzing art objects. Guest lecturers occasionally address the class.

Little attention has been paid to how to conceptualize gender and race/ethnicity; how to analyze the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and class essentialism (some call it \"class racism\"), and how to understand the relationships of these topics to the broader contexts of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism. This course is designed to offer a series of discussions about the following problems: (1) the historically specific modes of sexism and racism in social spaces related to Japan and other places in the trans-Pacific; (2) the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and social class in various contexts including those of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism; (3) the roles of gender, race, and social class in the United States' knowledge production about East Asia in general; and (4) the conceptions of gender and race in the social formations particular to East Asia.

Disgraced officials are sent to far-flung provinces, loyalists to past regimes hide out across China's borders, and dissidents have their entry visas revoked, making it impossible for them to return home. The experiences of these people, and the poems and stories they write, tell us a great deal about what it means and how it feels to be included and excluded. What is the difference between the way China looks from the inside and the way it looks from the outside? Who has the power to decide who gets to live in China, and how and why do they use it?

Drawing upon texts, media, and theory generated from South Asia and Latin America, the course will develop new comparative approaches to the constitutive role that bodies play in creating, maintaining, and imagining borders in the global South.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with ASIAN 6640/COML 6339/FGSS 6339/LSP 6339.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366854,"crseOfferNbr":4,"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4429","titleShort":"Walter Benjamin","titleLong":"Walter Benjamin","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17417,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jab857","firstName":"Jonathan","middleName":"Aaron","lastName":"Boyarin"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"McGraw Hall B65","bldgDescr":"McGraw Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MCGB65","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"4413","type":"B"},{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"7413","type":"B"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6429","type":"B"},{"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"4413","type":"B"},{"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"6413","type":"B"},{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"4913","type":"B"},{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"7913","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"4913","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"7913","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This extraordinary figure died in 1941, and his death is emblematic of the intellectual depradations of Nazism. Yet since World War II, his influence, his reputation, and his fascination for scholars in a wide range of cultural and political disciplines has steadily grown. He is seen as a bridging figure between German and Jewish studies, between materialist critique of culture and the submerged yet powerful voice of theology, between literary history and philosophy. We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":359367,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4700","titleShort":"Translation & Cult Diff","titleLong":"Translation and Cultural Difference","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15931,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ns32","firstName":"Naoki","middleName":"","lastName":"Sakai"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall G22","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URHG22","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"4481","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Problems concerning translation are explored. Although there are many different models of translation, we tend to be confined to the unilateral regime of translation, that is, the very narrow and historically specific mode of translation as a transnational transfer of significance between two national or ethnic languages. This course will survey theories of translation with special emphasis on relationships between trans-national translation and transnational transference. Translation establishes a division of two spheres and thereby marks the limit of what can be expressed in one medium. Broadly understood, translation can take place not only between two national languages but also at a variety of boundaries within a single society. We will investigate different economies of translation by which different social and cultural identities are constructed, emphasizing the disappearance of multi-lingualism in the modern nation-state and the mutation of translation tropics which has given rise to new ways of imagining the organicist unity of the society. Historical transformation of translation accompanying the genesis of linguistic and cultural identity will be examined in reference to historical materials. Furthermore, the course will explore the broader conception of translation in terms of which to critically understand communication as the ideology of Capital.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(KCM-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366754,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4706","titleShort":"Between Asia & Latin America","titleLong":"Between Asia and Latin America: Transpacific Trends in 20th Century Literature, Art, and Theory","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17103,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":7,"netid":"asb76","firstName":"Andrea","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Bachner"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"pre5","firstName":"Pedro","middleName":"Rabelo","lastName":"Erber"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"White Hall B14","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHTB14","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6706","type":"B"},{"subject":"PORT","catalogNbr":"4540","type":"B"},{"subject":"PORT","catalogNbr":"6540","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Asia and Latin America no longer occupy the disconnected extremes of an imagined map. Nor do they embody the antipodes of East and West, framing Europe and North America as the symbolic centers.  Rather, accelerated by recent geopolitical and global economic shifts, new connections between Asia and Latin America revive the \"swarmlike buzz of activity\" around and across the perimeter of the Pacific that Claude Lévi-Strauss had pitted against \"the great Atlantic silence\" prior to the European \"discovery\" of the Americas. This course explores different perspectives on the intercultural study of Asia and Latin America with the aim of rethinking the Transpacific as a method and a lens for comparison that challenges conventional geopolitical models, rather than simply an area or a region. To do so, we will explore multiple meanings, methodologies, and mappings of the Transpacific through a wide range of real and imagined links between Asian and Latin American literature, art, and theory: from diaspora, textual circulation, and cultural exchanges to uneven dialogues, compelling analogies, and conceptual affinities.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with COML 6706/PORT 6540.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":367003,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4783","titleShort":"Grammatechnics and the Bioarch","titleLong":"Grammatechnics and the Bioarchive","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16707,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"09:25PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"emo57","firstName":"Erin","middleName":"","lastName":"Obodiac"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 158","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH158","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar will explore new forms of biomedia such as transgenic art and tissue culture through the biosemiotic paradigm, which suggests that all life is regulated by \"linguistic\" principles and that DNA can be understood as a bioarchive or a mnemotechnics of inscription.

We will trace the concept of biopolitics and its attendant notions-Biopower, Sovereignty, Governmentality-as they emerge in the work of Michel Foucault and analyze the multiple disciplinary and geographical directions in which they have travelled. Throughout the semester, we shall examine 1. the innovative thinking around biopolitics in the works of Arendt, Esposito, Agamben, Hardt and Negri, 2. the connections and entanglements of the concept with postcolonial theory in Mbembe, Samaddar, Sakai, Mezzadra, 3. the extension and complication of biopolitical logistics over to non-human bodies in Uexküll, Sloterdijk, Wolfe, Shukin. Additionally, we will examine theorizations of new stylistics of power as well as emerging forms of agency and political organizing in the biopolitical sphere. Key terms include race, postcoloniality, animality, capture, embodiment, agency, technology.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with COML 6944/ROMS 6944.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":363878,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4999","titleShort":"Seminar in Theory","titleLong":"Seminar in Theory","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16538,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"asb76","firstName":"Andrea","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Bachner"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 160","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH160","meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Enrollment limited to: 15 undergraduate students.

We will examine major theoretical texts in relation to their historical contexts and more recent attempts to expand the field in new directions, including terrorism, nuclear threat, ecological catastrophe, neuroscience, legal contexts, political discourse, theological discourse, and non-Western contexts.. Questions will concern the nature of history, event, and testimonial archive as well as the changing question of (the language of) witness in a world in which traumatic repetition is bound up with historical erasure. Guest speakers include Robert Jay Lifton, Shoshana Felman, Elisabeth Weber, Elizabeth Rottenberg, John Zilkosky, Peter Balakian, Carolyn Dean, among others.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":359252,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6200","titleShort":"Independent Study","titleLong":"Independent Study","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":6816,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"tkm9","firstName":"Tracy","middleName":"K.","lastName":"McNulty"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"603","classNbr":18466,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"asb76","firstName":"Andrea","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Bachner"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"628","classNbr":18478,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"gcw1","firstName":"Geoffrey","middleName":"Carter W","lastName":"Waite"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"COML 6190 and COML 6200 may be taken independently of each other.

Our methodology, while non-reductionist, will take into account the current state of cognitive science, and also build on literary theory and philosophy (both \"analytic\" and \"Continental\"). Poetry makes use of cognitive structures and paths, of formal repetitions and algorithms-but it also alters and challenges the usual boundaries of thought. Thus, we need to consider both the ordinary and the extraordinary, if we ever want to explain the mental performance of the poetic. A comparative corpus of poems (written in European languages, from Antiquity to the 20th century) will be used throughout the semester.

One of the goals of this seminar is to think these rulings together instead of treating them as separate entities. How did the struggle for sexual rights and the promotion of color blindness come to coexist so easily within the law? In order to understand how liberalism has operated historically and theoretically as a crucial site of regulation for sexuality and race, we will read texts from a wide range of contexts and disciplines including political theory, anthropology, literature, philosophy, history, and law. Readings will include \"classic\" critics of liberalism such as Marx, Nietzsche, Althusser, and Foucault, and contemporary authors such as Wendy Brown, Elizabeth Povinelli, Lisa Duggan, David Eng, Janet Halley, Katherine Franke, and Jasbir Puar, among others.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366633,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6631","titleShort":"Marx & Marxisms","titleLong":"Marx and Marxisms","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16386,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"gcw1","firstName":"Geoffrey","middleName":"Carter W","lastName":"Waite"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Olin Library 403","bldgDescr":"Olin Library","facilityDescrshort":"OLL403","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"6100","type":"C"},{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"6706","type":"C"},{"subject":"SPAN","catalogNbr":"6100","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The terms \"Marx\" and \"Marxisms\" have meant different things to different people, beginning with Marx himself and continuing in his legacy today.  As obviously, this legacy remains global (Europe, North and Latin America, India and Pakistan, Vietnam, Africa, Near East and Far East)—all still including imagined allies, neutrals, and foes.  This seminar is an approach to this otherwise bewildering complexity: we focus on two things: (1) a possible Marxist (or Communist or Anarchist) theory of all language and any semiotics; alongside (2) its equally possible inter-action with manuals of guerrilla warfare.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":355400,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6680","titleShort":"Race & Gender-Asian Hist & Lit","titleLong":"Theorizing Gender and Race in Asian Histories and Literatures","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15936,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ns32","firstName":"Naoki","middleName":"","lastName":"Sakai"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 494","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH494","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"3388","type":"B"},{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"6688","type":"B"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"3980","type":"B"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"3580","type":"B"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"6580","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"For a long time area studies have overlooked the questions of gender, race/ethnicity, and social class in fields related to East Asia and the trans-Pacific regions.

The experiences of these people, and the poems and stories they write, tell us a great deal about what it means and how it feels to be included and excluded. What is the difference between the way China looks from the inside and the way it looks from the outside? Who has the power to decide who gets to live in China, and how and why do they use it?

Nor do they embody the antipodes of East and West, framing Europe and North America as the symbolic centers. Rather, accelerated by recent geopolitical and global economic shifts, new connections between Asia and Latin America revive the \"swarmlike buzz of activity\" around and across the perimeter of the Pacific that Claude Lévi-Strauss had pitted against \"the great Atlantic silence\" prior to the European \"discovery\" of the Americas. This course explores different perspectives on the intercultural study of Asia and Latin America with the aim of rethinking the Transpacific as a method and a lens for comparison that challenges conventional geopolitical models, rather than simply an area or a region. To do so, we will explore multiple meanings, methodologies, and mappings of the Transpacific through a wide range of real and imagined links between Asian and Latin American literature, art, and theory: from diaspora, textual circulation, and cultural exchanges to uneven dialogues, compelling analogies, and conceptual affinities.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with COML 4706/PORT 4540.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366880,"crseOfferNbr":4,"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6725","titleShort":"Medieval Travel Writing","titleLong":"Medieval Travel Writing","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15652,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"05:30PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"smt24","firstName":"Shawkat","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Toorawa"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Comstock Hall-Academic II B104","bldgDescr":"Comstock Hall-Academic II","facilityDescrshort":"CMSB104","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"6740","type":"C"},{"subject":"MEDVL","catalogNbr":"6740","type":"C"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"6740","type":"C"},{"subject":"SPAN","catalogNbr":"6740","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"We will read a selection of medieval travel accounts, paying special attention to the ways in which travelers observed, interacted with, and described the people they encountered and the places they visited.

\"finitude\" or decompletion of language dooms to failure any attempt to construct or transmit the objects of thought and experience.  If the \"finitist\" view is often identified with the structuralism of Jacques Lacan or with Jacques Derrida's influential account of the \"supplement\" (a tropological understanding of language as founded upon lack and substitution), recent critics of finitude have turned to practices like mathematical formalization (Badiou, Meillassoux) or to such concepts as \"desiring machines\" (Deleuze and Guattari), the \"figural\" (Lyotard), the \"event\" (Badiou), \"plasticity\" (Malabou) or \"ancestrality\" (Meillassoux) to elaborate approaches to the construction or transmission of an object that are characterized either as extra-linguistic or as modalities of language not conditioned by lack or substitution, which pretend to \"write the real\" rather than to re-present it tropologically in the mode of repression or negation.  We will focus our attention on three linguistic modes that purport to straddle the alleged gap between language and its \"real\": figure, fetish, and formalization.  In addition to the authors mentioned above, readings will include selections from Quintillian,Paul, Auerbach, Foucault, and Perniola, as well as literary works by Sade, Sacher-Masoch, Lautréamont, Mallarmé, Gide.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366996,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6944","titleShort":"Biopolitics","titleLong":"Biopolitics","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16545,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"nd326","firstName":"Naminata","middleName":"","lastName":"Diabate"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"agt24","firstName":"Antoine","middleName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Traisnel"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Uris

(Africa, Far East, South East Asia, and the Americas). We will trace the concept of biopolitics and its attendant notions-Biopower, Sovereignty, Governmentality-as they emerge in the work of Michel Foucault and analyze the multiple disciplinary and geographical directions in which they have travelled. Throughout the semester, we shall examine 1. the innovative thinking around biopolitics in the works of Arendt, Esposito, Agamben, Hardt and Negri, 2. the connections and entanglements of the concept with postcolonial theory in Mbembe, Samaddar, Sakai, Mezzadra, 3. the extension and complication of biopolitical logistics over to non-human bodies in Uexküll, Sloterdijk, Wolfe, Shukin. Additionally, we will examine theorizations of new stylistics of power as well as emerging forms of agency and political organizing in the biopolitical sphere. Key terms include race, postcoloniality, animality, capture, embodiment, agency, technology.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with COML 4944/ROMS 4944.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":359370,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6970","titleShort":"Cosmopolitanism","titleLong":"Cosmopolitanism","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17114,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ncs5","firstName":"Neil","middleName":"Charles","lastName":"Saccamano"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall G24","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSHG24","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"6970","type":"C"},{"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"6779","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course will examine cosmopolitanism as a cultural, moral, and political concept both historically, with reference primarily to the eighteenth century, and theoretically, in contemporary debates. The aim will be to elaborate critically the universalist and egalitarian premises of the Enlightenment notion of cosmopolitical subjects and to evaluate what progressive or ideological functions this notion continues to play in discourses on sovereignty, human rights, religious tolerance, and cultural dissemination and aesthetic community. Works by Cicero, Hobbes, Adam Smith, Rousseau, Kant, and Marx will be read with those by Arendt, Balibar, Derrida, Habermas, Honig, and other contemporary theorists.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"}]
