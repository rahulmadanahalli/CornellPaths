Sentiments are mobilized to defend borders, wage wars, grant asylum to refugees, provide medical care and disaster relief, and inspire feminist activism.

Drawing from writings in continental philosophy and phenomenology, the challenge of the class will be to inquire into how sensation in particular broadens notions of citizenship and politics. How do accounts of sensation in political theory reconceive citizenship? What are possible conceptual practices for unraveling normative, colonial, and authoritarian definitions of the political subject? What is the place of sensation in theories of relationality? Students will also be asked to critique the terms under which citizenship is constrained, defined, and regulated. In addition, the course will examine how accounts of sensation delineate traces and figures excluded from the rights conferred by organized polities. In order to account for those excluded from citizenship, the seminar will also consider the role of sight, touch, and imagination in the public realm or, as Hannah Arendt writes, \"namely, the faculty of seeing things not only from one's own perspective but from that of all others who are present.\" Facing the challenge of Arendt's words, the course will reflect on the implications of critique, judgment, and phenomenology for democratic theory in general. Discussions may, for example, seek to uncouple the rhetoric of sovereignty and law from citizenship. Finally, we will ask what a study of sensation provides for redressing and/or accounting for dispossession. As students will be encouraged to integrate their research interests with course reading, topics may include questions of how philosophies of anarchism, civil disobedience, feminism, queer theory, and decolonization broaden ideas of citizenship and political ethics.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":366513,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SHUM","catalogNbr":"4992","titleShort":"Affective Ecologies","titleLong":"Affective Ecologies","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16618,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"dl36","firstName":"Dana","middleName":"Marie","lastName":"Luciano"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"A D White House 109","bldgDescr":"A D White House","facilityDescrshort":"ADW109","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4026","type":"C"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"4992","type":"C"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4992","type":"C"},{"subject":"LGBT","catalogNbr":"4992","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar considers the points of intersection between theories of affect, emotion, and sexuality in recent queer and feminist thought, and the set of critical and cultural developments that has come to be called the \"nonhuman turn.\" We will explore contemporary critical attention to the agential, sensory and cognitive capacities of the non-human, considering how this body of work reconfigures the relations between human and nonhuman worlds, and the more flexible and nuanced accounts of \"nature\" and \"environments\" that they make possible.

But on the other hand, the topic of sensation suggests ways of reading classical and early modern literature as transhistorical works of art, following Deleuze and Guattari's claim that \"Art thinks no less than philosophy, but it thinks through affects and percepts\" that form \"compounds of sensations.\" We'll focus on the interweaving of sensation with physiology and environment, through attention to Metamorphosis, Humoral Embodiment, and Darkness. Readings include Aristotle, Ovid, Seneca, Shakespeare, Spenser, Milton, Hobbes, Descartes, Spinoza, Deleuze &amp; Guattari, Foucault, Heidegger, and Cassirer.\nFor longer description and Fellows' bios please visit www.arts.cornell.edu/sochum/index.html.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":366672,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"SHUM","catalogNbr":"6308","titleShort":"Flux Navigations","titleLong":"Flux Navigations: Biopolitics and Urban Aesthetics in the Contemporary SE Asian City","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17268,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"jf252","firstName":"Jeremy","middleName":"","lastName":"Foster"},{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"aif32","firstName":"Arnika","middleName":"I.","lastName":"Fuhrmann"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Sibley Hall 261B","bldgDescr":"Sibley Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SBL261B","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARCH","catalogNbr":"6308","type":"B"},{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"6682","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course critically addresses accounts of Southeast Asia's port and delta metropolises as sites of economic and cultural transformation as part of recent power shifts in the region.
