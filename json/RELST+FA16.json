For most of its existence it has also been a national capital or major provincial center for the many states and empires which vied for control of the vital land bridge connecting Africa, Europe and Asia. Thus many of the pivotal events which shaped western civilization were played out in the streets and structures of Jerusalem. This class will explore the history, archaeology, natural topography and role of Jerusalem throughout its long life, from its earliest remains in the Chalcolithic period (ca. 4000 B.C.E.) to the 19th century, including Jebusite Jerusalem, Jerusalem as the capital of the Davidic dynasty, the Roman era city of Herod and Jesus, the Crusaders and medieval Jerusalem, and Ottoman Jerusalem as the city entered the modern era. Students will examine the original historical sources (e.g. the Bible, Josephus, the Madeba map, etc.) which pertain to Jerusalem. PowerPoint lectures will be used to illustrate the natural features, man-made monuments, and artifacts which flesh out the textual material, providing a fuller image of the world's most prominent spiritual and secular capital.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":365936,"crseOfferNbr":6,"subject":"RELST","catalogNbr":"3226","titleShort":"Art of Late Antiquity","titleLong":"Art of Late Antiquity","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15821,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"bwa32","firstName":"Benjamin","middleName":"William","lastName":"Anderson"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall G22","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSHG22","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARKEO","catalogNbr":"3226","type":"B"},{"subject":"ARKEO","catalogNbr":"6226","type":"B"},{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"3226","type":"B"},{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"6226","type":"B"},{"subject":"CLASS","catalogNbr":"3746","type":"B"},{"subject":"MEDVL","catalogNbr":"3226","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"3226","type":"B"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"3226","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"A survey of the art and architecture of the later Roman Empire, from the reign of Trajan to the reign of Justinian I.

Philosophers often disembody meaning, but feminist and queer theory have intersected with philosophy to insist on the importance of what is (as Jeanette Winterson writes) \"written on the body\"—inscribed on and as the skin. In theology, some readings of the Hebrew Bible see skin as a barrier between human and divine; others read skin color as a sign of divine dis/favor; still others worry about wounds and other stigmata. We will look at ways that skin is \"marked\" as readable, and at modes in which this is valued or disvalued, how it stigmatizes or registers as blank.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.
