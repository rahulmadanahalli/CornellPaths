industrialism societies?  Is there a \"ruling class?\"  Are lifestyles, attitudes, and personalities shaped fundamentally by class membership?  Can individuals born into poverty readily escape their class origins and move upward in the class structure?  Are social contacts and \"luck\" important forces in matching individuals to jobs and class positions?  What types of social processes serve to maintain and alter racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination in labor markets?  Is there an \"underclass?\"  These and other questions are addressed in light of classical and contemporary theory and

Numerous examples are taken from a variety of policy areas, including crime, education, health, welfare, and regulation.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: PAM 2000, PAM 2300.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Explain how to conduct cost-benefit analysis of government projects.","Calculate the discounted present value of future costs and benefits.","Evaluate distributional effects of public policies.","Apply uncertainty and risk to policy analysis.","Explain how to evaluate non-market activities such as environmental policy and the value of a statistical life."],"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"HE"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":367829,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PAM","catalogNbr":"5400","titleShort":"Economics of Consumer Policy","titleLong":"Economics of Consumer Policy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16940,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"st96","firstName":"Sharon","middleName":"","lastName":"Tennyson"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Prerequisite: PAM 2000 or equivalent or permission of instructor.
