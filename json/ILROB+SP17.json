Organizations are constantly adapting to changing environments and employees are constantly required to adapt to new organizational settings. This adaptation is not simple, and employees exhibit a large variety of responses to it, ranging from active resistance to proactive championing. In this course we will focus on these, its sources, and the routes to researching it. Contrary to most investigations of the change process, our focus will be on the employee's perspective of the change process. Our aim will be to learn about the different reasons employees have for resisting or supporting changes, and the means through which these reasons have been studied. We will address a variety of possible sources and consider the implications of these sources for the effective management of change. We will analyze several cases in class, through which we will learn to identify and better understand the antecedents of employees' reactions to change.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":368730,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"ILROB","catalogNbr":"3770","titleShort":"Money, Work and Social Life","titleLong":"Money, Work and Social Life","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":18380,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"fg266","firstName":"Filiz","middleName":"","lastName":"Garip"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"Morrill Hall 106","bldgDescr":"Morrill Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MRL106","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"3770","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Through a diverse set of readings and other media, this course offers a multi-disciplinary account of how our economic life (money and work) is intertwined with our social life (networks and culture).
