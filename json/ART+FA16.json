Topics explored include time-based art, network culture, image resolution, computational techniques, virtuality, and interactivity.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AAP, LA-AAP)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AR"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":359541,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ART","catalogNbr":"2907","titleShort":"Visual Imaging in Electron Age","titleLong":"Visual Imaging in the Electronic Age","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":5493,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dpg5","firstName":"Donald","middleName":"P.","lastName":"Greenberg"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Milstein Hall 101","bldgDescr":"Milstein Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MLS101","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"If the class is full and you wish to be put on the waitlist, please e-mail Sarah Brewer at skb99@cornell.edu.\n\nMandatory informal discussions TBA. http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/ART2907FINALAnnouncement.pdf"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARCH","catalogNbr":"3702","type":"C"},{"subject":"CS","catalogNbr":"1620","type":"C"},{"subject":"ENGRI","catalogNbr":"1620","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2016","sessionEndDt":"12/02/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Interdisciplinary survey course designed to introduce students in the creative arts, science, and engineering to the concepts of 2D and 3D digital pictorial representation and display.

We will explore how the visions of urban and rural spaces reflect the evolving cultural, social and political fabric of a nation in a period of rapid and often traumatic historical change. The course will feature screening of films set in several Italian locations, from Rome to Milan, from Naples to Venice, from Sicily to the Apennines, and represent different moments of Italian contemporary history. We will take advantage of the unique opportunity to study this cinema while residing in Rome and traveling in Italy, through the experience of the real settings that have figured so prominently in Italian cinema. Each session consists of an in-class lecture and a film screening.
