Attentive to the relationship between black feminist criticism and black queer theory, this class proceeds with an understanding of gender and sexuality as intrinsic to the study of blackness in global contexts. Readings will include essays and books from Audre Lorde, E. Patrick Johnson, Christina Sharpe, Robert Reid Pharr, and others. Students will also engage popcultural texts, such as films, music videos, and novels to address the conjecture of blackness and sexuality in critical and vernacular discourse.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":365308,"crseOfferNbr":5,"subject":"LGBT","catalogNbr":"6945","titleShort":"Body Politics Afr Lit & Cin","titleLong":"Body Politics in African Literature and Cinema","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17253,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"nd326","firstName":"Naminata","middleName":"","lastName":"Diabate"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Rockefeller Hall B16","bldgDescr":"Rockefeller Hall","facilityDescrshort":"RCKB16","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"4995","type":"B"},{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"6945","type":"B"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4945","type":"B"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6945","type":"B"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"4741","type":"B"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4945","type":"B"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"6945","type":"B"},{"subject":"LGBT","catalogNbr":"4945","type":"B"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4945","type":"B"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"6945","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The course examines how postcolonial African writers and filmmakers engage with and revise controversial images of bodies and sexuality-genital cursing, same-sex desire, HIV/AIDS, genital surgeries, etc. Our inquiry also surveys African theorists' troubling of problematic tropes and practices such as the conception in 19th-century racist writings of the colonized as embodiment, the pathologization and hypersexualization of colonized bodies, and the precarious and yet empowering nature of the body and sexuality in the postcolonial African experience. As we focus on African artists and theorists, we also read American and European theorists, including but not certainly limited to Giorgio Agamben, Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, and Joseph Slaughter, detecting the ways in which discourses around bodies in the African context may shape contemporary theories and vice versa.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with ASRC 4995/COML 4945/ENGL 4741/FGSS 4945/LGBT 4945/VISST 4945.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"}]
