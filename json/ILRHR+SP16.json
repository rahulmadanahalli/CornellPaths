This suggests that much work remains to be done in organizations. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to current theory, research, and practice regarding discrimination and inclusion in the workplace.  We will begin by defining diversity and the multiple existing justifications for \"managing diversity\" within organizations. We will then examine bias within organizations, including its root cause in stereotyping and power differentials, and its manifestation in the implementation of HR practices, the treatment of employees, and in broader society. We will also explore the impact of demographic diversity on the functioning of work groups/teams, particularly as it relates to commonly made arguments about the \"business case\" for diversity.  We will spend some time discussing the role of HR and diversity practices in fostering inclusion, and the important role of an organization's climate and culture. Finally, we will begin to explore the role of leaders and change agents in fostering diversity and inclusion.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring (seven-week session).","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":363827,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRHR","catalogNbr":"6410","titleShort":"Disability Considerations","titleLong":"Disability Considerations in HR Policy and Practice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":14869,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:00PM","timeEnd":"10:00PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"03/18/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"smb23","firstName":"Susanne","middleName":"Marie","lastName":"Bruyere"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 109","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS109","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"03/18/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"7W1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"03/18/2016","sessionLong":"Seven Week - First"}],"description":"Despite the two decades that have passed since the passage of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, individuals with disabilities continue to face numerous obstacles to gaining and maintaining employment within the U.S. workforce.

The first two days focus on self-awareness and employs several experiential exercises and self-assessment instruments including, Leadership 360 Assessment, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI), and the Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation-Behavior (FIRO-B). Class members will be trained in giving and receiving feedback from team members. Activities in the last days of the course will include various leadership and team challenges.  Professional feedback providers will observe students in group work on leadership cases and exercises and provide feedback on their observations and the results of individual instruments. The final day of the course students will focus on goal setting for future leadership development.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"ILR students must take for a letter grade, all others S/U only.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 36 graduate students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":350707,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRHR","catalogNbr":"9600","titleShort":"Workshop in HR Studies","titleLong":"Workshop in Human Resource Studies","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":14446,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:15PM","timeEnd":"02:45PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"bal93","firstName":"Beth","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Livingston"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall G26","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URHG26","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Provides a forum for the presentation and critical discussion of current research being undertaken by graduate students, faculty members, and invited guests in the field of human resource studies.
