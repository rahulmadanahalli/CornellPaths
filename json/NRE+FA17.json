It consists of three parts. The first part covers arbitrage pricing theory, including the Black Scholes Merton, the Heath Jarrow Morton, and reduced form credit risk models. The second part covers portfolio theory, in both complete and incomplete markets. The third part studies equilibrium pricing models, both complete and incomplete markets, including the notion of market efficiency. This course emphasizes continuous time models and it is based on the use of martingales to understand asset pricing theory. Included in the course is the extensions of the standard theories to include asset price bubbles.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"}]
