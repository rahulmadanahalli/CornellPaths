The usual add/drop policy applies, and retroactive credit for work commenced after an academic semester has ended is not allowed. Projects are conducted under the direction of a faculty member, and regular, frequent consultations are mandatory. Also, a written report must be produced and made available to all faculty members and students of the school after its submission to the supervising faculty member. Up to 3 credits for independent study projects may not count toward the SHA elective requirements. Any over 3 credits will be free electives only. Students cannot earn academic credit for independent study when the equivalent material is offered in a regular course, and credit is not earned for teaching a course.

They assess how well the students are able to lead, take direction, work with others, present ideas, and listen to other ideas. At the end of the class, one or more of the industry \"coaches\" meet with students individually, and in teams, to evaluate performance. This centerpiece of the orientation process is designed to outline some of the personal and career goals students will want to work toward in the coming year.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"Required.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: M.M.H. students or permission of instructor.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"HA"}]
