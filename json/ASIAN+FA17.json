Through case studies of familial and conjugal love in Africa, Asia, the US, Europe, and South and Latin America, the course will examine the debates about and enactment's of what constitutes the appropriate way to show love and affection in different cultures and historical contexts. Among the themes we will explore are questions of sexuality, marriage, kinship, and gender rights. A final unit will examine these themes through modern technologies such as the Internet, scientific advances in medicine, and a growing awareness that who and how we love is anything but simple or universal.","catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogLang":null,"catalogForbiddenOverlaps":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogFee":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"catalogPermission":null,"catalogCourseSubfield":null,"catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":350262,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"2208","titleShort":"Intro to Southeast Asia","titleLong":"Introduction to Southeast Asia","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":9057,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"aif32","firstName":"Arnika","middleName":"","lastName":"Fuhrmann"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"201","classNbr":9058,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:15AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"aif32","firstName":"Arnika","middleName":"","lastName":"Fuhrmann"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""},{"ssrComponent":"DIS","ssrComponentLong":"Discussion","section":"202","classNbr":9059,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"aif32","firstName":"Arnika","middleName":"","lastName":"Fuhrmann"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":false,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC","DIS"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course introduces critical issues in the study of Southeast Asia (Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) related to geography, history, religion, ideology, language, literature, society, culture, and politics and also in the ways that scholars have thought about them.

general introduction to the study of Japan in the humanities and social sciences.

Our discussions examine how these themes are addressed in different academic disciplines. We will explore ways different groups of Japanese people (intellectuals, bureaucrats, business people, religious figures, etc.) have imagined themselves as members of a collectivity or nation, and how these ways of framing identity have been picked up, celebrated, contested and projected back onto Japan by people outside of Japan. We are particularly interested in the following frames of Japaneseness:  1) Japan the divine nation; 2) Japan the aesthetic country; 3) Japan the warrior nation; 4) Japan the industrious economic miracle; and 5) Japan the vanishing and/or hypermodern.  For each section of the course, we will explore how a particular frame is presented as \"truth,\" how the frame gets produced,  consumed and understood, and some of the implications of the frame as a mode of cultural self-knowledge.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall (may be offered winter or summer).","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"(GE)","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":353026,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"2245","titleShort":"Gamelan In Indo Hist&Culture","titleLong":"Gamelan in Indonesian History and Cultures","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":6430,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"03:20PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"cjm299","firstName":"Christopher","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Miller"}],"pattern":"MF","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"03:20PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"MUSIC","catalogNbr":"1341","type":"C"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"2744","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course combines hands-on instruction in gamelan, Indonesia's most prominent form of traditional music, and the academic study of the broader range of music found in contemporary Indonesia, including Western-oriented and hybrid popular forms.

begun.  What sort of society emerged from the cooperation and conflict between occupiers and occupied?  Students will examine sources ranging from declassified government documents to excerpts from diaries and bawdy fiction, alongside major scholarly studies, to find out.  The first half of the course focuses on key issues in Japanese history, like the fate of the emperor, constitutional revision, and the emancipation of women.  The second half zooms out for a wider perspective, for the occupation of Japan was never merely a local event.  It was the collapse of Japanese empire and the rise of American empire in Asia.  It was decolonization in Korea and the start of the Cold War.  Students will further investigate these links in final individual research

The first part of the course will deal with Indian Buddhism: the Buddha, the principal teachings and practices of his early followers, and new developments in spiritual orientation. We will then turn to the transmission of Buddhism to Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, where at least one of the early schools has been preserved. Next we will look at Mahayana Buddhism as it moves north and east, encompassing China, Japan, and Tibet. While much of the course will be devoted to developments in traditional times, we will also look at some of the ways Buddhist cultures have responded to modernity.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"(RL)","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":367319,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"3307","titleShort":"Issues in Contemporary China I","titleLong":"Issues in Contemporary China I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":9034,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:30PM","timeEnd":"06:00PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rm253","firstName":"Robin","middleName":"","lastName":"McNeal"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The course is attached to the Cornell Contemporary China Initiative lecture series, which brings high profile speakers on various aspects of contemporary China to Cornell most Mondays throughout the semester.  Students will attend one or two foundation-setting lectures by the instructor, then attend weekly guest lectures &amp; write short assignments.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Can be repeated for credit up to a total of 3 times.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"(SC)","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":363844,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"3310","titleShort":"Heavens, Hells & Purgatories","titleLong":"Heavens, Hells, and Purgatories: Buddhist and Christian Notions of the Afterlife","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16037,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"djb38","firstName":"Daniel","middleName":"Joseph","lastName":"Boucher"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"RELST","catalogNbr":"3310","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course will explore a variety of ways people have envisioned and prepared for the afterlife.

With fresh eyes and surprising insights, it will take you beyond the fashionable fictions and clichés to look at the twenty-five years during which the United States, through six presidential administrations, was involved in Vietnamese affairs (1950-1975). For decades, Americans have been meditating on \"the lessons of the Vietnam War,\" but it turns out that neither was any lesson ever learned nor were the so-called \"lessons\" even plausibly related to actual events. Today, Americans continue to be taught myths about the Vietnam War. This course shows why these myths obstruct a realistic understanding of American history during the past half-century.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"(SC)","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":362933,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"3318","titleShort":"WiM: Literature/Media in Japan","titleLong":"Literature and Media in Japan","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":9489,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:00AM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"bmd2","firstName":"Brett","middleName":"","lastName":"de Bary"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"3150","type":"C"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"3318","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Beginning with the mid-nineteeth century, the course traces dynamic relays and reciprocal influences among woodblock prints, maps, fiction, films, anime, comics, and digital arts in Japan.

and revolution.  This seminar, designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, explores the links between sexual, political, and scientific revolutions in Asia from the 1500s to the present.  The focus is on China and Japan, with secondary attention to South Asia and Korea.  Interaction with the West is a major theme.  Topics include disease control, birth control and population control, the history of masculinity, the science of sex, normative and stigmatized sexualities, honorific violence, body modification, fashion, disability, and eugenics.  We first explore the body in \"traditional\" Asian cultures, legal regimes, and medical practice.  We then explore the modernization of sex, health, and the body itself under the major rival political movements in Asia: imperialism, nationalism, communism, and feminism.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":363783,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"4446","titleShort":"Classical

With the advent of Western and American colonialism and imperialism, coupled with recent successes in westernization by the Japanese, Chinese artists had to redefine their roles as well as their visions. This turmoil bore witness to a vibrant beginning in modern Chinese art. Interactions between the Chinese themselves, and Chinese interactions with foreigners in the major cities of Shanghai and Beijing, fostered new directions in Chinese art and helped shape western visions of Chinese art history. Issues covered include: Chinese debates on western influence--their theoretical foundations and rationales; New visions for the future of Chinese art in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; Pluralistic approaches and arguments on \"Chinese identity\" in the modern era; Collecting art and the vision of history; The identity of traditional literati painters in the modern era-their roles, artworks, and deeds; Foreigners in China-the formation of major European collections of Chinese art, and the formation of \"Chinese art history\" in the West.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"(SC)","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":352447,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"4475","titleShort":"China and Asian Security","titleLong":"China and Asian Security","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16094,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"arc26","firstName":"Allen","middleName":"R.","lastName":"Carlson"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Government seniors and juniors given preference.

With the advent of Western and American colonialism and imperialism, coupled with recent successes in westernization by the Japanese, Chinese artists had to redefine their roles as well as their visions. This turmoil bore witness to a vibrant beginning in modern Chinese art. Interactions between the Chinese themselves, and Chinese interactions with foreigners in the major cities of Shanghai and Beijing, fostered new directions in Chinese art and helped shape western visions of Chinese art history. Issues covered include: Chinese debates on western influence--their theoretical foundations and rationales; New visions for the future of Chinese art in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; Pluralistic approaches and arguments on \"Chinese identity\" in the modern era; Collecting art and the vision of history; The identity of traditional literati painters in the modern era-their roles, artworks, and deeds; Foreigners in China-the formation of major European collections of Chinese art, and the formation of \"Chinese art history\" in the West.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"(SC)","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":355400,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"6688","titleShort":"Race & Gender-Asian Hist & Lit","titleLong":"Theorizing Gender and Race in Asian Histories and Literatures","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16060,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:40AM","timeEnd":"12:55PM","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ns32","firstName":"Naoki","middleName":"","lastName":"Sakai"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/22/2017","endDt":"12/01/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6680","type":"C"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"6580","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/22/2017","sessionEndDt":"12/01/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"For a long time area studies have overlooked the over-determined links of gender, race/ethnicity, and social class in fields related to East Asia and the trans-Pacific regions.

The genesis of traditional kingdoms, the role of monumental architecture (such as Angkor in Cambodia and Borobodur in Indonesia), and the forging of maritime trade links across the region are all covered. Religion - both indigenous to Southeast Asia and the great imports of Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam - are also surveyed in the various premodern polities that dotted Southeast Asia. This course questions the region's early connections with China, India, and Arabia, and asks what is indigenous about Southeast Asian history, and what has been borrowed over the centuries.
