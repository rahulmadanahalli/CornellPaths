The number of credits for which students may register are arranged on an individual basis. Note: Students commit themselves to a certain number of credits of independent academic work per week per credit hour if they choose to do an independent study project, and the work must be performed in the semester for which the student is enrolled in the independent study. The usual add/drop policy applies, and retroactive credit for work commenced after an academic semester has ended is not allowed. Projects are conducted under the direction of a faculty member, and regular, frequent consultations are mandatory. Also, a written report must be produced and made available to all faculty members and students of the school after its submission to the supervising faculty member. Up to 3 credits for independent study projects may not count toward the SHA elective requirements. Any over 3 credits will be free electives only. Students cannot earn academic credit for independent study when the equivalent material is offered in a regular course, and credit is not earned for teaching a course. Students should consider all aspects of their situation before committing themselves to an independent study project. Enrollment forms are available in the Office of Student Services, 180 Statler Hall.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-UGR)","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"Elective.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"HA"},{"strm":2615,"crseId":364990,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"HADM","catalogNbr":"6135","titleShort":"Conversations w/ Entrepreneurs","titleLong":"Conversations with Entrepreneurs","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1031,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"12/28/2015","endDt":"01/23/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mao24","firstName":"Mona Anita","middleName":"Kristiansen","lastName":"Olsen"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Online Winter Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.
