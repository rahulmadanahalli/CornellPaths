What kinds of images emerged, and what purposes did they serve? What did the buying public do with these images on paper? Taught in the Johnson Museum with its extensive collection of prints and co-led by curator of European art Andrew Weislogel and director Stephanie Wiles, the first aim of this seminar is to experience original masterworks by the most prominent printmakers of the period, including Mantegna, Dürer, Goltzius, Rembrandt, and Hogarth. We will consider the techniques and materiality of prints, look at fakes and forgeries, and discuss patterns of publishing and collecting. A second aim is to examine through analysis of weekly readings themes that concerned printmakers and their viewers. Among class topics are religion and allegory, witches and beggars, humor and satire, portraits of people, cities, and landscapes, issues of self-fashioning, invention, and replication, and prints as sites of knowledge about the expanding world.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":354513,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4563","titleShort":"Lightin Design Studio II","titleLong":"Lighting Design Studio II","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"STU","ssrComponentLong":"Studio","section":"501","classNbr":7930,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"edi1","firstName":"Edward","middleName":"David","lastName":"Intemann"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts 120","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZ120","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["STU"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"4620","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Concentrates on designing lighting for different genres of performance in various venues.

Collecting, describing, narrating and ultimately creating of human, plant, and animal species is as much at the heart of Biodiversity in Art as it is a method in Art History and Biology. Situated at the intersection of science and aesthetics, this course explores the creative and often symbiotic, shape-shifting encounters between humans, flora and fauna from early Greek and Roman accounts to Asian articulations through time. Students will be encouraged to apply various methodologies in the writing process as they engage these collecting impulses and unruly passions. Classes will be held at the Herbert F. Johnson Museum.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":364903,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"6155","titleShort":"Topics in Latin American Art","titleLong":"Topics in Latin American Art","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17178,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"aic42","firstName":"Ananda","middleName":"","lastName":"Cohen-Aponte"},{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"mf252","firstName":"Maria","middleName":"","lastName":"Fernandez"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 156","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH156","meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Art and Politics in Latin America: From Revolution"}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPI","gradingBasisShort":"Opt NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"4155","type":"B"},{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"6155","type":"B"},{"subject":"LATA","catalogNbr":"4155","type":"B"},{"subject":"LATA","catalogNbr":"6155","type":"B"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4155","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Topic for spring 2017: Art and Politics in Latin America: From Revolution to Dissimulation","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":363882,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"6341","titleShort":"Aesthetics of Excess","titleLong":"Aesthetics of Excess: Psycho-Philosophical Approaches to Cinematic Technologies","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17210,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:00PM","timeEnd":"09:00PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"tcm1","firstName":"Timothy","middleName":"Conway","lastName":"Murray"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"A D White House 201","bldgDescr":"A D White House","facilityDescrshort":"ADW201","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6341","type":"C"},{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"6341","type":"C"},{"subject":"FREN","catalogNbr":"6341","type":"C"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"6441","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The rise of cinema and mechanized representational technologies has provided an informative backdrop for a century long reflection on aesthetics and the excesses of affect, sentiment, and corporeality in relation to modern/postmodern formulations of subjectivity, community, politics, race, and sexuality. Emphasizing French Psycho-Philosophical approaches to cinematic technologies, the course will rehearse the intellectual backdrop for understanding this Aesthetics of Excess with readings in Freud, Bergson, Artaud, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty in order to frame discussion of later twentieth and twenty-first century reflections on the balance between aesthetics and cinematic and new media technologies. In dialogue with a range of films and digital artworks, we will analyze texts to be chosen from Fanon, Barthes, Simondon,Lyotard, Deleuze, Derrrida, Kristeva, Laplanche, Stiegler, Duguet, Bellour, Nancy, and Rancière.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":363553,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"6601","titleShort":"Space, Gender, Body","titleLong":"Space, Gender, Body in Early Modern Art","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16198,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lp286","firstName":"Lisa","middleName":"","lastName":"Pincus"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 158","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH158","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"4601","type":"B"},{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"6601","type":"B"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4601","type":"B"},{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"6601","type":"B"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4601","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The body is a universal. How we construct our understandings of it is not. In this class we will investigate conceptions and treatment of the early-modern body (1400-1700) mainly in Europe with excursions to China, Japan, Africa. Among our topics will be: classical understanding of the body and gender; cross-cultural practices of medicine and anatomy; aesthetics and the nude; definitions of beauty and the grotesque. Criminal, sinful and saintly bodies; death, the macabre, and  the mortal, divine body of Christ; the ambiguous gender of children; the formation of identity through portraiture; the science of sexuality and art of erotics as well as correspondences among bodies, domestic and public spaces, the macrocosm and microcosm will round out our study. We will work with historical materials with an eye for current practices in bodily identities.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":363027,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"6818","titleShort":"Exhibition Seminar","titleLong":"Exhibition Seminar","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17201,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ap76","firstName":"An-Yi","middleName":"","lastName":"Pan"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Johnson Museum Of Art 2L34","bldgDescr":"Johnson Museum Of Art","facilityDescrshort":"JMA2L34","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"4818","type":"B"},{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"6818","type":"B"},{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"4433","type":"B"},{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"6610","type":"B"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4818","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Public display of art objects and artifacts involves more than just artistic presentations.
