The Bible itself will be the primary text for the course, but students will also be exposed to the rich and diverse textual traditions of the ancient Near East, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, Moab, and Ugarit. In addition, this course will explore the impact of early biblical interpretation on shaping the monotheistic traditions inherited in the West. As participants in a secular course on the Bible, students will be challenged to question certain cultural assumptions about the composition and authorship of the Bible, and will be expected to differentiate between a text's content and its presumed meaning.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366861,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"2788","titleShort":"Heroines, ArchVillians and Ant","titleLong":"Heroines, ArchVillians and AntiHeroes","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15622,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"smt24","firstName":"Shawkat","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Toorawa"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 142","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH142","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"2755","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"What makes a heroine heroic?

We will focus on social as well as political themes including the Anglo-Russo-American Occupation of Iran, the 1979 Islamic Revolution, U.S.-Iranian relations, Iraq-Iran War, the Green Movement and the crisis of Islamic government, Images of the West in Iran, Modern Youth Culture, Gender segregation, and the struggle between modernity and traditionalism in contemporary Iran.

We will read and watch what the Iranians wrote and produced, read and watched, in order to view and explain Iran and its relations with the West through the Iranian eyes. We will examine how the Iranians perceived themselves and the others, how they viewed their own governments and the West, what issues inspired and shaped their outlook outside the official censorship during the period in question.

What is the Gospel of Judas and are its ideas \"heretical\"? Who wrote the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary and why were these Gospels not included in the New Testament canon? To what extent did Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code draw from ancient Christian gnostic sources? This seminar will explore answers to these questions and many others by focusing on the complex array of literary sources from late antiquity-primarily from a cache of manuscripts found at Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945-that have long been associated with a so-called \"Christian Gnosticism.\" Church Fathers condemned the \"movement\" on a variety of grounds, but in this course we will not simply read the condemnations written by the opponents of gnostic thought; rather, we will focus our attention on reading (in English translation) substantial portions of the \"gnostic\" texts written by the adherents themselves. We will give special attention to the ways in which conflicts about Gnosticism connected with conflicts about gender, heresy, power, and authority. To set these texts within a socio-historical context, we will discuss the possible Jewish and hellenistic roots of early Christian Gnosticism and ties to Stoic and other ancient philosophical movements.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366746,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"4634","titleShort":"Shi'i Islam in Southeast Asia","titleLong":"Shi'i Islam in Southeast Asia","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17552,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:00PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"cf398","firstName":"Chiara","middleName":"","lastName":"Formichi"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 303","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH303","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"4434","type":"B"},{"subject":"ASIAN","catalogNbr":"6634","type":"B"},{"subject":"RELST","catalogNbr":"4434","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Structured as a seminar, this course explores various aspects of Shi'i Islam (in cultural, literary, intellectual, ritual, legal, and political terms) in its historical emergence and contemporary manifestations across Southeast Asia.

For the war not only spelled the end of an empire that had united the region for well over 400 years, but it also meant the creation of new national borders, new state structures, colonial occupation, the entrenchment of settler colonialism, and a drastic upheaval in traditional socio-cultural orders. Despite the important role that the Ottoman Empire played in the war, and the deep and long-lasting impact the war had on the region, academic interests in the Great War has mostly focused on European experiences. This seminar, which will be offered in conjunction with a number of events taking place on campus, will turn the spotlight onto this important topic. Even though classic texts will be used in this seminar, the focus will be on newer scholarship dealing with the social and political history of the Ottoman Empire on the eve of the war, the experience of the war on the frontline and at home in the Middle East, and the impact of the war on the region in the first half of the 20th century. Thematically, the course will focus on trials of imperialism at the end of the 19th century, the study of the emergence of new forms of complex identifications in the region, the long-term impact of colonialism, and the emergence of nationalism. A basic background in the history of the region is strongly preferred, but not required.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with HIST 6544/NES 6641.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":359067,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"4700","titleShort":"Methods in Medieval","titleLong":"Methods in Medieval","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16505,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"bwa32","firstName":"Benjamin","middleName":"William","lastName":"Anderson"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"cr94","firstName":"Cynthia","middleName":"","lastName":"Robinson"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall G24","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSHG24","meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Narratives of Medieval Art"}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"4310","type":"B"},{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"6310","type":"B"},{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"4310","type":"B"},{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"6310","type":"B"},{"subject":"MEDVL","catalogNbr":"4310","type":"B"},{"subject":"MEDVL","catalogNbr":"6310","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"6700","type":"B"},{"subject":"RELST","catalogNbr":"4310","type":"B"},{"subject":"RELST","catalogNbr":"6310","type":"B"},{"subject":"SPAN","catalogNbr":"4570","type":"B"},{"subject":"SPAN","catalogNbr":"6590","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Topic for spring 2015: Narratives of Medieval Art","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with ARTH 6310/JWST 6310/MEDVL 6310/NES 6700/RELST 6310/SPAN 6590.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366881,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"4776","titleShort":"Talmud and the Art of Reading","titleLong":"Talmud and the Art of Reading","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15654,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"zs283","firstName":"Zvi","middleName":"","lastName":"Septimus"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"White Hall 104","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT104","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"CLASS","catalogNbr":"4637","type":"C"},{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"4776","type":"C"},{"subject":"RELST","catalogNbr":"4776","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The Babylonian Talmud has long been viewed as the central text of post-Biblical Judaism. Yet little is known about who wrote it and when it was written. Since the Talmud is an extremely difficult text to master, its readership has therefore until recently been limited to few expert traditional scholars. Over the past fifty or so years, with the advent of translations and study guides, the Talmud has gained increasing popularity. The Talmud has long been viewed as a source for history, law, or moral lessons. But literature interacts with the cultures that produce and read it in far more nuanced and significant ways. In the past century, advances in theories of how and why to read literature have opened up new avenues for understanding what the Talmud says and, more importantly, how it works . This course will examine provocative, bizarre, and salacious Talmud passages through the lens of the evolution of the major theoretical schools of the past century. Each week we will explore a theoretical movement ( e.g. New Criticism, Formalism, Post-Stucturalism, Feminist Criticism, New Historicism , etc .) and apply their reading strategies to close readings of Talmud passages. We will simultaneously read the work of modern Talmud scholars whose reading practices align with each of these theoretical schools. All Texts will be read in translation and no previous knowledge of Talmud or Critical Theory is necessary.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":366854,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"4913","titleShort":"Walter Benjamin","titleLong":"Walter Benjamin","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15880,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jab857","firstName":"Jonathan","middleName":"Aaron","lastName":"Boyarin"}],"pattern":"T","facilityDescr":"McGraw Hall B65","bldgDescr":"McGraw Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MCGB65","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"4413","type":"B"},{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"7413","type":"B"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"4429","type":"B"},{"subject":"COML","catalogNbr":"6429","type":"B"},{"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"4413","type":"B"},{"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"6413","type":"B"},{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"4913","type":"B"},{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"7913","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"7913","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This extraordinary figure died in 1941, and his death is emblematic of the intellectual depradations of Nazism.

Even though classic texts will be used in this seminar, the focus will be on newer scholarship dealing with the social and political history of the Ottoman Empire on the eve of the war, the experience of the war on the frontline and at home in the Middle East, and the impact of the war on the region in the first half of the 20th century.  Thematically, the course will focus on trials of imperialism at the end of the 19th century, the study of the emergence of new forms of complex identifications in the region, the long-term impact of colonialism, and the emergence of nationalism.  A basic background in the history of the region is strongly preferred, but not required.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with HIST 4544/NES 4641.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":357781,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"6661","titleShort":"Sumerian Language&Culture I","titleLong":"Sumerian Language and Culture I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":15619,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jst229","firstName":"Jonathan","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Tenney"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"White Hall B06","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHTB06","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARKEO","catalogNbr":"3661","type":"B"},{"subject":"ARKEO","catalogNbr":"6661","type":"B"},{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"3661","type":"B"},{"subject":"JWST","catalogNbr":"6661","type":"B"},{"subject":"NES","catalogNbr":"3661","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/21/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course is an intense introduction for undergraduate and graduate students to the earliest written language, Sumerian, and its cuneiform script.

Talmud and the Art of Reading) in the original Aramaic and Hebrew.  We will explore important manuscript variations as well as the grammatical and lexical nuances of the original primary sources.  We will also address how the tools of source and text criticism can be applied to the Talmud.  The purpose of this companion course is to further develop reading skills as well as address textual issues that cannot be properly dealt with in translation.  Some previous acquaintance with reading Talmud in its original language is necessary for enrollment in this course.  Please contact the instructor if you have questions about whether your reading level is appropriate for this course. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: Enrollment in NES

Yet since World War II, his influence, his reputation, and his fascination for scholars in a wide range of cultural and political disciplines has steadily grown. He is seen as a bridging figure between German and Jewish studies, between materialist critique of culture and the submerged yet powerful voice of theology, between literary history and philosophy. We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with ANTHR 4413/JWST 4913/NES 4913.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"}]
