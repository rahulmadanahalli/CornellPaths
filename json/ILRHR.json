By the completion of the course, participants will know how to design pay ranges and grades for organizations where most jobs can be benchmarked with market data. The course will also devote considerable time to the design of incentive plans, including merit pay, bonuses, gainsharing, profit sharing, piece-rate, tipping, and commission systems. It is useful for those desiring employment as an entry-level compensation specialist, a HR generalist, those starting and running their own business, or those who want a better understanding of how HR practices are actually managed. For students with a particular interest in compensation, the course can be taken in addition to ILRHR 6690 (or other compensation courses available at Cornell); for those interested in compensation in the services industry, this course can be taken as a standalone course.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: ILRHR 2600.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":367011,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRHR","catalogNbr":"4615","titleShort":"Socially Responsible Business","titleLong":"Socially Responsible Business","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16681,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"03/16/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jeg68","firstName":"Joe","middleName":"","lastName":"Grasso"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 217","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS217","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"03/16/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ILRHR","catalogNbr":"6615","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"03/16/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"}],"description":"HR leaders are now being asked to lead the CSR function, to head the company foundation, or to create programs that engage employees in the community.  They are also asked to oversee compliance around corporate ethics, whistleblower provisions, and to help safeguard the company reputation.  This course will examine how corporations and non-profits are engaging in socially beneficial activities as well as how some have engaged in socially harmful activities.  The course begins with an overview of key regulatory and voluntary compliance regimens such as the Sarbanes Oxley Act, Dodd-Frank, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FASB regulations, and the conflict of interest and ethics policies of domestic and international corporations and non-profits.  We will then review the policies, programs, and cultures of certain corporations and non-profits that have allowed them to create strong and good reputations as well as examples of corporations that have engaged in fraudulent and unethical behavior.  We will discuss such diverse topics as impact investing by corporations, the excesses of executive compensation, bribery, product liability and operational debacles, and the role and value of good organizational reputations.  Some of the companies and countries we will focus on include:  Merck Corporation (US), Tata Corporation (India), Yara (Norway), Coca Cola (Mexico), Environmental Defense Fund (US), Accenture (US), Chiquita (South America).  Students will be evaluated on class participation, two short papers or projects, and a final exam. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.

This suggests that much work remains to be done in organizations. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to current theory, research, and practice regarding discrimination and inclusion in the workplace.  We will begin by defining diversity and the multiple existing justifications for \"managing diversity\" within organizations. We will then examine bias within organizations, including its root cause in stereotyping and power differentials, and its manifestation in the implementation of HR practices, the treatment of employees, and in broader society. We will also explore the impact of demographic diversity on the functioning of work groups/teams, particularly as it relates to commonly made arguments about the \"business case\" for diversity.  We will spend some time discussing the role of HR and diversity practices in fostering inclusion, and the important role of an organization's climate and culture. Finally, we will begin to explore the role of leaders and change agents in fostering diversity and inclusion.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring.

Through modern and historical case studies, the course critically evaluates the received wisdom about entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial organizations. This course is intended for advanced undergraduate students and MILR students who are interested in learning more about entrepreneurship. It is not a \"How to\" course but rather a conceptual overview of entrepreneurship with particular emphasis on labor market and employment-related topics. Students will examine various forms of entrepreneurship, including self-employment, franchising, small and family businesses, high- technology ventures, and social entrepreneurship. An important concern of the course is how entrepreneurship is different for different categories of people, especially women and minorities.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: graduate students, junior, and senior undergraduate students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"SP15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":367012,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRHR","catalogNbr":"6615","titleShort":"Socially Responsible Business","titleLong":"Socially Responsible Business","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16680,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"03/16/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jeg68","firstName":"Joe","middleName":"","lastName":"Grasso"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 217","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS217","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"03/16/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ILRHR","catalogNbr":"4615","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"03/16/2015","sessionEndDt":"05/06/2015","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"}],"description":"HR leaders are now being asked to lead the CSR function, to head the company foundation, or to create programs that engage employees in the community.  They are also asked to oversee compliance around corporate ethics, whistleblower provisions, and to help safeguard the company reputation.  This course will examine how corporations and non-profits are engaging in socially beneficial activities as well as how some have engaged in socially harmful activities.  The course begins with an overview of key regulatory and voluntary compliance regimens such as the Sarbanes Oxley Act, Dodd-Frank, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FASB regulations, and the conflict of interest and ethics policies of domestic and international corporations and non-profits.  We will then review the policies, programs, and cultures of certain corporations and non-profits that have allowed them to create strong and good reputations as well as examples of corporations that have engaged in fraudulent and unethical behavior.  We will discuss such diverse topics as impact investing by corporations, the excesses of executive compensation, bribery, product liability and operational debacles, and the role and value of good organizational reputations.  Some of the companies and countries we will focus on include:  Merck Corporation (US), Tata Corporation (India), Yara (Norway), Coca Cola (Mexico), Environmental Defense Fund (US), Accenture (US), Chiquita (South America).  Students will be evaluated on class participation, two short papers or projects, and a final exam. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.

perspectives from management and economics, this course explores diverse factors such as individual characteristics and organizational practices that affect the levels and methods of pay (not only wages and salaries, but also such things as bonuses, contingent rewards, benefits, and working conditions).  The course also examines several recent pay related issues that have been in the news such as increasing the minimum wage and pay inequality.  By the completion of the course, students will  have a better understanding of what goes into the making of pay decisions and why it matters.  Since the course is designed as a broad overview of the topic (and not as a \"how-to\" of compensation administration) there is no prerequisite for

This suggests that much work remains to be done in organizations. The purpose of this course is to introduce current theory, research, and practice regarding discrimination and inclusion in the workplace.  We will adopt a largely psychological approach to understanding bias, stereotyping, and prejudice and how they manifest in organizations. We will also examine the role of HR and diversity practices as well as leadership behaviors in fostering inclusion. A guiding assumption for this course is that in order to fully understand the implications of diversity for organizations you must personally confront issues having to do with power, privilege, stereotypes, identity, and discrimination. Toward this end, we will adopt an experiential approach whenever possible. Writing assignments will include a mix of personal reflections and scholarly analysis.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: ILRHR

This suggests that much work remains to be done in organizations. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to current theory, research, and practice regarding discrimination and inclusion in the workplace.  We will begin by defining diversity and the multiple existing justifications for \"managing diversity\" within organizations. We will then examine bias within organizations, including its root cause in stereotyping and power differentials, and its manifestation in the implementation of HR practices, the treatment of employees, and in broader society. We will also explore the impact of demographic diversity on the functioning of work groups/teams, particularly as it relates to commonly made arguments about the \"business case\" for diversity.  We will spend some time discussing the role of HR and diversity practices in fostering inclusion, and the important role of an organization's climate and culture. Finally, we will begin to explore the role of leaders and change agents in fostering diversity and inclusion.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring (seven-week session).","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":363827,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRHR","catalogNbr":"6410","titleShort":"Disability Considerations","titleLong":"Disability Considerations in HR Policy and Practice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":14869,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:00PM","timeEnd":"10:00PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"03/18/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"smb23","firstName":"Susanne","middleName":"Marie","lastName":"Bruyere"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 109","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS109","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"03/18/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"7W1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"03/18/2016","sessionLong":"Seven Week - First"}],"description":"Despite the two decades that have passed since the passage of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, individuals with disabilities continue to face numerous obstacles to gaining and maintaining employment within the U.S. workforce.

Students will be asked to read a number of books and articles ¿ including scholarly works and contemporary news pieces ¿ and critically analyze the ways in which work and family intersect, conflict and enhance one another in the lives of employees and the organizations in which they work.  The course will be centered on academic research in human resources and organizations, differential focuses in areas such as psychology and sociology, and analyses of popular discussions of sometimes controversial topics.

This suggests that much work remains to be done in organizations. The purpose of this course is to introduce current theory, research, and practice regarding discrimination and inclusion in the workplace.  We will adopt a largely psychological approach to understanding bias, stereotyping, and prejudice and how they manifest in organizations. We will also examine the role of HR and diversity practices as well as leadership behaviors in fostering inclusion. A guiding assumption for this course is that in order to fully understand the implications of diversity for organizations you must personally confront issues having to do with power, privilege, stereotypes, identity, and discrimination. Toward this end, we will adopt an experiential approach whenever possible. Writing assignments will include a mix of personal reflections and scholarly analysis.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: ILRHR

pressing social problems and current approaches to solving them.  The problems will vary from year to year (possibilities include, for example, food insecurity and barriers to post-secondary education).  After an introduction to the social impact landscape and a review of frameworks and tools for social impact, we will meet with researchers, business leaders, and non-profit leaders to

This suggests that much work remains to be done in organizations. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to current theory, research, and practice regarding discrimination and inclusion in the workplace.  We will begin by defining diversity and the multiple existing justifications for \"managing diversity\" within organizations. We will then examine bias within organizations, including its root cause in stereotyping and power differentials, and its manifestation in the implementation of HR practices, the treatment of employees, and in broader society. We will also explore the impact of demographic diversity on the functioning of work groups/teams, particularly as it relates to commonly made arguments about the \"business case\" for diversity.  We will spend some time discussing the role of HR and diversity practices in fostering inclusion, and the important role of an organization's climate and culture.

We will then move into a discussion of human resource management topics related to the hiring, career development, and performance management of people with disabilities.

This suggests that much work remains to be done in organizations. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to current theory, research, and practice regarding discrimination and inclusion in the workplace.  We will begin by defining diversity and the multiple existing justifications for \"managing diversity\" within organizations. We will then examine bias within organizations, including its root cause in stereotyping and power differentials, and its manifestation in the implementation of HR practices, the treatment of employees, and in broader society. We will also explore the impact of demographic diversity on the functioning of work groups/teams, particularly as it relates to commonly made arguments about the \"business case\" for diversity.  We will spend some time discussing the role of HR and diversity practices in fostering inclusion, and the important role of an organization's climate and culture. Finally, we will begin to explore the role of leaders and change agents in fostering diversity and inclusion.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring (seven-week session).","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":367016,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRHR","catalogNbr":"6440","titleShort":"Forging the Future of Work","titleLong":"Forging the Future of Work in America","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":14432,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"03/19/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ldd3","firstName":"Lee","middleName":"D.","lastName":"Dyer"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"03/19/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ILRHR","catalogNbr":"4440","type":"W"}],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"03/19/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Seven Week -
