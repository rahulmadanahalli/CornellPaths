Debates concerning the delivery, regulation and financing of health care have intensified. This course uses basic economic tools to analyze central questions in health care today, as well as fundamental issues in health policy: For example, what is the current role of the government in the health sector, and what should it be? What is the social insurance role of the government, and how is it played out in policies that impact the health of the population? How is health insurance structured, and what are the implications of having employers be the providers of private health insurance? This course is about applying economic tools of policy analysis to gain insight into the workings of the health care system and to analyze current issues in health policy.

The impact of legislative, public, social, economic, or religious policies on the incidence of such violence is considered.

Violence against women is committed to protect women's virginity, because women are viewed as property, for political reasons, as hate crimes, and in the name of culture, religion, and tradition. The types of violence discussed in this course include rape, child sexual abuse, homicide, battering, domestic violence, hate crimes, gay bashing, kidnapping, ethnic cleansing, war crimes, forced prostitution, female genital mutilation, honor killings, public beating, lashing, stoning, torture, infanticide, trafficking of women, forced abortions, acid attacks, and sati (self-immolation).

We begin with study of the marginal analysis that describes the \"optimal\" or the \"efficient\" amount of any activity. We then examine the basic model of a market that describes how the price mechanism allocates resources if prices are able to move freely. We move on to several basic policy rationales for intervention in a market. Those include externalities, public goods, natural monopoly, and contracting problems, among others. We consider various forms of intervention, including taxes and subsidies, industry and economy-wide regulation, as well as innovative approaches such as tradable property rights and permits. Both normative and positive theories of regulation are examined, including the capture, economic (or private interest), pure public interest, and hybrid theories. Those approaches are applied to specific types of regulation, including individual industry-level regulation (e.g. electricity, trucking, postal services), as well as to broader social regulation (e.g. health, safety, environment). The effect of deregulation and other regulatory reforms in several industries will be assessed. Current policy issues related to government intervention in the marketplace will also be discussed along the way.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":["Students will be able to explain the motivation and rationale for various types of government intervention in the marketplace.","Students will be able to explain the standard set of rationales for government intervention, as well as the importance of history and the details of institutional arrangements to thoroughly understand that intervention.","Students will be able to explain the actual effect of intervention and why some forms of regulation have been eliminated or modified over time."],"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"HE"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":366454,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PAM","catalogNbr":"5340","titleShort":"Market Regulation","titleLong":"Regulation and Infrastructure Policy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16162,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"rrg24","firstName":"Rick","middleName":"","lastName":"Geddes"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Statler Hall 445","bldgDescr":"Statler Hall","facilityDescrshort":"STL445","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Infrastructure provides essential services such as road and highway transportation, ports and airports, communications, electricity, clean drinking water, and wastewater treatment.
