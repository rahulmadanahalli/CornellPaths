incorporate insights and strategies from the business world, as well as collaborative efforts that span the divide that too often exists between business, government, and non-profit sectors.  This class is designed to provide the information, examples, and analytical mindset that are required to develop rigorous, insightful, and effective approaches to analyzing social ills and crafting potential solutions.  Special emphasis is given to the ways in which insights from the business world are and can be used to reshape the social sector.  We will examine the nature and extent of two pressing social problems and current approaches to solving them.  The problems will vary from year to year (possibilities include, for example, food insecurity and barriers to post-secondary education).  After an introduction to the social impact landscape and a review of frameworks and tools for social impact, we will meet with researchers, business leaders, and non-profit leaders to learn what's not working, what is working, and what might work even better. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment

This suggests that much work remains to be done in organizations. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to current theory, research, and practice regarding discrimination and inclusion in the workplace.  We will begin by defining diversity and the multiple existing justifications for \"managing diversity\" within organizations. We will then examine bias within organizations, including its root cause in stereotyping and power differentials, and its manifestation in the implementation of HR practices, the treatment of employees, and in broader society. We will also explore the impact of demographic diversity on the functioning of work groups/teams, particularly as it relates to commonly made arguments about the \"business case\" for diversity.  We will spend some time discussing the role of HR and diversity practices in fostering inclusion, and the important role of an organization's climate and culture. Finally, we will begin to explore the role of leaders and change agents in fostering diversity and inclusion.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring (seven-week session).","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":363827,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"ILRHR","catalogNbr":"6410","titleShort":"Disability Considerations","titleLong":"Disability Considerations in HR Policy and Practice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15309,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"10:00PM","startDt":"03/20/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"smb23","firstName":"Susanne","middleName":"Marie","lastName":"Bruyere"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 109","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS109","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"03/20/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2,"unitsMaximum":2,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"7W2","sessionBeginDt":"03/20/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Seven Week - Second"}],"description":"Despite the two decades that have passed since the passage of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, individuals with disabilities continue to face numerous obstacles to gaining and maintaining employment within the U.S. workforce. We will begin the course with a discussion of the importance of this problem - for people with disabilities, employers, and for society at large - and then discuss employment legislation that has been passed in an effort to improve the employment of people with disabilities. A major component of this legislation has to do with reasonable accommodations, yet there continues to be insufficient understanding of what constitutes a reasonable accommodation and the likely costs associated with providing these accommodations, both of which we will cover in the third week of the course. We will then move into a discussion of human resource management topics related to the hiring, career development, and performance management of people with disabilities.
