How does advertising sell the current dystopia as \"cool capitalism\"? And what roles do race and gender play? This seminar examines fictions (written and cinematic) that maintain but also contest global capitalism as the dominant social, economic, and political order. With Marx's and later Marxist writings, we consider such \"fables\" as Roland Barthes, Mythologies; Thomas Pynchon, The Crying of Lot 49; David Fincher, Fight Club; and Lizzie Borden, Born in Flames. Analyzing these texts and constructing arguments about them will hone our analytical reading and critical writing skills.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":367077,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"1150","titleShort":"FWS: German Lyric Poetry","titleLong":"FWS: German Lyric Poetry","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17667,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"km393","firstName":"Klas Erik","middleName":"","lastName":"Molde"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 348","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH348","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information about First-year Writing Seminars, see the Knight Institute website at http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"FWS","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"FWS Session"}],"description":"Friedrich Hölderlin, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Paul Celan are arguably the most influential lyric poets to have written in German.  Although each responded to events of his day (the French Revolution, First World War, and Second World War, respectively), they all aspired to transcend their immediate contexts.

This course explores seriality in literature and popular culture (television, film, new media) and examines the strategies of suspense, entertainment, and anticipation that connect installments or episodes into novels, seasons, series, and franchises.

We will also discuss more recent films with surprising links to both film noir and German expressionism, including Blue Velvet (1986), Dark City (1998), and The Big Lebowski (1998).

Two main questions guide the course: what are the key patterns of argument related to time in the Western tradition? How did scientific knowledge, cross-cultural encounters and methodological disputes shape or change these patterns? The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were a period of rapid temporal expansion in both extent and detail: geology shifted the scale of time, and chronological work propelled claims for a truly \"universal\" history.  Departing from these developments, the course explores how temporal ideas have functioned within and shaped different disciplinary and institutional contexts.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment

an interdisciplinary examination of the fin-de-siècle as a crucial turning point in literature, art (painting, music, theater), architecture, psychoanalysis as well as literary and cultural criticism. We will focus particularly on the \"Wiener Moderne\" as a laboratory for the negotiation of the relationship between tradition and innovation (\"decadence\"), between art and life (\"aestheticism\"). This entails an exploration of experiments with literary language and form (short prose, essay, interior monologue) and of crucial concepts at the threshold of modernity: Sexuality and gender, history and myth, representation and the limits thereof, and, as the central, precarious and 'nervous' center: the decentered subject. \"Viennese modernism\" (including current critical standpoints) will be supplemented by the investigation of modernisms at the periphery of the Austrian Empire, i.e. Prague and Budapest, and of the so-called \"Berliner Moderne. Authors include Nietzsche, Freud, Benjamin, Bahr, Mach, Broch, Musil, Hofmannsthal, Schnitzler, Loos, Altenberg, Kraus, Kokoschka, Andreas-Salomé, Kafka, Lukacs, Mayreder.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Anchor Course.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":362157,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"6241","titleShort":"Topics in German Philosophy","titleLong":"Topics in German Philosophy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":7600,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dhs258","firstName":"Daniel","middleName":"Harrison Sumner","lastName":"Smyth"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall G20","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URHG20","meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Kantian Approaches to Self-Consciousness"}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"4170","type":"B"},{"subject":"PHIL","catalogNbr":"4240","type":"B"},{"subject":"PHIL","catalogNbr":"6240","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Discussion of an advanced topic in German philosophy.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":351368,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"6320","titleShort":"Reading Academic German II","titleLong":"Reading Academic German II","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":5054,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:05AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":6,"netid":"wlk45","firstName":"William","middleName":"Lawrence","lastName":"Krieger"}],"pattern":"MWF","facilityDescr":"Olin Library 403","bldgDescr":"Olin Library","facilityDescrshort":"OLL403","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Limited to graduate students.

Selected readings are exemplary rather than comprehensive and focus on literature, philosophy, and critical theories of language and history.
