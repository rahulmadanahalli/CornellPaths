Topics include: Bodies on Drugs (pharmaceutical drugs for trans* subjects; the medicalization of gendered bodies; bioscience and race); Drugs and Global Health (global inequities in access to drugs; colonial legacies in drug production and clinical trials); Drugs and Everyday Racism and Sexism (how people's experiences and lifeworlds are shaped by racialized and gendered dimensions of drug use and illegality); and Drugs, Law Enforcement, and Mass Incarceration (how the war on drugs intersects with racism in the US to produce the world's highest incarceration rates, while fostering violence across the globe). Throughout the course, we will examine how human rights and social justice activism shape public debates about drugs; we will also meet with local activist groups.

Do nonhuman animals display sex-specific behaviors mediated by brain structure, and can we extrapolate these findings to human behavior? Are there physical representations of sexual orientation in the brain, and how are these related to gender identity? And how are scientific studies represented and misrepresented in popular debate?

The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? Does hip hop allow a space for alternative femininities?

We will focus on reading novels by Morrison, including The Bluest Eye, Sula (1973), Song of Solomon (1977), Beloved (1987), Jazz (1992), Paradise (1998), Love (2003) and A Mercy (2008). The presentation of her novels in trilogy form and her contributions to the genre of historical writing will be given some consideration. We will explore the author's stylistic innovation and expansion of this genre. We will consider topics such as how to read novels critically. In this course, we will examine some of the distinctions between how novels are discussed and written about in popular and academic contexts.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":359782,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"6835","titleShort":"Performance Studies","titleLong":"Performance Studies: Theories and Methods","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17937,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:00PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"slw42","firstName":"Sara","middleName":"L.","lastName":"Warner"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts 124","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZ124","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"FGSS","catalogNbr":"4835","type":"B"},{"subject":"LGBT","catalogNbr":"4835","type":"B"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"4835","type":"B"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"6835","type":"B"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4835","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"An understanding of performance as object and lens, modality and method, is integral to scholarship and research across the humanities and social sciences. Charting the advent and defining principles of performance studies, this course explores the interdisciplinary history of the field, including its association with anthropology, visual studies, theater, gender studies, sociology, psychology, literature, philosophy, and critical race studies. This class examines performance as a means of creative expression, a mode of critical inquiry, and an avenue for public engagement. We will attend to both the practice of performance - as gesture, behavior, habit, event, artistic expression, and social drama - and the study of performance - through ethnographic observation, spectatorship, documentation, reproduction, analysis, and writing strategies.
