Parasites have also been found in coproliths from latrines and cave habitations from the Middle Pleistocene and from dinosaurs living in the early Cretaceous. Vectors and their parasites have been found in ambers that are from the Eocene. The application of modern molecular methods has added greatly to identification of these parasites of the past and have allowed new interpretations of the various agents that people have carried with them as they have traveled around the globe.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: an introductory biology course and BIOMS 3310, BIOMS 4310, or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":366623,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"BIOMS","catalogNbr":"4340","titleShort":"Cellular Microbiology","titleLong":"Cellular and Molecular Microbial Pathogenesis: The Host/Pathogen Interplay","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16359,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"09:55AM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dpd22","firstName":"Dorothy","middleName":"P.","lastName":"Debbie"},{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"dgr8","firstName":"David","middleName":"G.","lastName":"Russell"},{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"grw7","firstName":"Gary","middleName":"R.","lastName":"Whittaker"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Plant Science Building 143","bldgDescr":"Plant Science Building","facilityDescrshort":"PLS143","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Recommended prerequisite: BIOMS/BIOMI 4040 or BIOMS/BIOMI/PLPA 4090 or BIOMS/BIOMI 4310 or BIOMS 3150 or permission of the instructor.

A range of medically relevant human and animal pathogens will be detailed, focusing on the host's response to commensalism versus disease, the mechanisms of host invasion, nutrient acquisition, and modulation of the host's immune response. The course will also discuss current disease interventions and the challenges facing antimicrobial therapy and vaccine development.
