The course considers the limited effectiveness of these responses for addressing the causes and effects of genocide despite the vow of \"never again.\" To pursue these questions, students will read selections from novels and poetry written by Cambodian survivors, along with historical accounts of the genocide and analysis attempts by the Cambodian government and the international community to bring the perpetrators to justice.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"(SC)","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"}]
