This course begins in the late nineteenth century, defining it as a pivotal moment in U.S. immigration and labor history when efforts to regulate immigrant entry and naturalization became increasingly bureaucratized. As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective. We will also address questions regarding the perceived benefit and cost of immigration at both the national and local (i.e., community) levels. In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time. Finally, we will consider how immigrants have negotiated the pressures of their new surroundings, and challenged dominant conceptions of American national identity and citizenship in the process.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":366036,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"LSP","catalogNbr":"3400","titleShort":"Being and Becoming Black","titleLong":"Being and Becoming Black","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":8804,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"02:40PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ol43","firstName":"Oneka","middleName":"","lastName":"LaBennett"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Africana Ctr B01","bldgDescr":"Africana Ctr","facilityDescrshort":"AFCB01","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3402","type":"C"},{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"3400","type":"C"},{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"3400","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course is about being Black throughout the Atlantic world.

We will explore the disparate cultural, national, historical and intellectual contexts in which Black identities are constructed, revealing both commonalities and differences. Paying specific attention to how racial identity is shaped by social context, the course will interrogate theories of Black identity formation and notions of Black nationhood, and will examine different perspectives on Diaspora theory. While readings are interdisciplinary in approach, our understandings of Blacks in the Atlantic world will be informed by ethnographic, historical and literary texts covering many cultural contexts including the U.S., England, Kenya, South Africa, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.

Cultura! No más lágrimas, and the Latino Civic Association. The core idea is that students will learn while participating in meaningful activities that will enhance arts and culture partnerships. Faculty will provide guidelines and resources for students to work within existing projects or to develop their own ideas; community partners will provide networks and planning assistance. All students will be asked to develop a comprehensive learning portfolio on their semester's work.
