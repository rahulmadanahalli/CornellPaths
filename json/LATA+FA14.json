It traces the modalities of culture, power, and representation in the framing of Andean pasts and presents by tracing the social lives of images in Andean South America, which encompasses parts of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina. We will analyze a range of visual material, including textiles, paintings, photographs, and even tourist brochures to understand the dynamics of image-making and image consumption in the Andes. Given the seminar's broad temporal scope, we will embark on a series of case studies that serve to contextualize each historical moment of artistic production, from the Inca and colonial periods to the postcolonial period spanning the 19th century to the present. The final section of the course focuses on the politics of marketing \"Andeanness\" to contemporary audiences through museum displays, folkloric performances, and tourism. Readings will be drawn from an array of disciplines, including art history/visual culture studies, and anthropology.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with ARTH 6161/LATA 6161.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":350323,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"LATA","catalogNbr":"4250","titleShort":"Books of Fate, Ancestors: Astr","titleLong":"Books of Fate, Books of the Ancestors: Astrology and History in Ancient Mesoamerica","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16303,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jsh6","firstName":"John","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Henderson"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"McGraw Hall 215","bldgDescr":"McGraw Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MCG215","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ANTHR","catalogNbr":"4256","type":"C"},{"subject":"ARKEO","catalogNbr":"4256","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"An introduction to belief systems in ancient Mexico and Central America, emphasizing the blending of religion, astrology, myth, history, and prophecy.

Using these frameworks as a point of departure, we examine a range of particular issues that connect diasporic Latino communities around specific cultural practices, including the politics of claiming space, the making of a Latina/o public sphere, transnational and multilingual imaginaries, cultural production and consumption, and alternative/subversive performance practices.  Texts may include works by authors like Carmelita Tropicana, Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Victor Hugo Rascón Banda, Nilo Cruz, Miguel Piñero, and Cristina Michaus.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with COML 6349/LSP 6349.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2573,"crseId":360045,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"LATA","catalogNbr":"6000","titleShort":"Issues in Latin/Latino America","titleLong":"Contemporary Issues in Latin-Latino America","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":6554,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"01:10PM","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":7,"netid":"tjd5","firstName":"Tim","middleName":"","lastName":"Devoogd"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 202","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH202","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/26/2014","endDt":"12/05/2014","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"LATA","catalogNbr":"4000","type":"B"},{"subject":"LSP","catalogNbr":"4000","type":"B"},{"subject":"LSP","catalogNbr":"6000","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/26/2014","sessionEndDt":"12/05/2014","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"An exploration of critical topics in the anthropology, art, economics, history, literature, political science, and sociology of Latin American and U.S. Latino contexts.
