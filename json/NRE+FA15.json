The focus of the course is on both theoretical and empirical work. The course will evaluate the main theoretical models and their applications. Increasingly issues in microstructure are empirical in nature, and we will spend time on the empirical approaches used in such research. Because information issues are fundamental to many of the issues covered, this course should be of interest to students in Finance, Economics, and Accounting. This course is structured to introduce students to interesting research problems in the securities markets.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":362022,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NRE","catalogNbr":"5040","titleShort":"PhD Seminar - Empirical Resrch","titleLong":"PhD Seminar - Gathering Data for Empirical Research","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"001","classNbr":18460,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:45PM","timeEnd":"05:30PM","startDt":"10/16/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rjb9","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Bloomfield"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall B10","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGHB10","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"02:40PM","timeEnd":"05:00PM","startDt":"08/28/2015","endDt":"08/28/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rjb9","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Bloomfield"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 127","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH127","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":3,"timeStart":"04:15PM","timeEnd":"07:15PM","startDt":"08/31/2015","endDt":"08/31/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rjb9","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Bloomfield"}],"pattern":"M","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 135","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH135","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":4,"timeStart":"02:45PM","timeEnd":"05:45PM","startDt":"09/11/2015","endDt":"09/11/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rjb9","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Bloomfield"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":"Sage Graduate Hall 131","bldgDescr":"Sage Hall","facilityDescrshort":"SGH131","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Non-Johnson Students ONLY:  August 10th at 8:00am to September 8th at 4:00pm.
