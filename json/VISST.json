But how did these images affect the roles that black men and women played on and off the screen and the portrayal of the black body in contemporary society? This interdisciplinary course explores the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in addressing the body in art, film, photography and the media.

We will analyze a range of visual material, including textiles, paintings, photographs, and even tourist brochures to understand the dynamics of image-making and image consumption in the Andes. Given the seminar's broad temporal scope, we will embark on a series of case studies that serve to contextualize each historical moment of artistic production, from the Inca and colonial periods to the postcolonial period spanning the 19th century to the present. The final section of the course focuses on the politics of marketing \"Andeanness\" to contemporary audiences through museum displays, folkloric performances, and tourism.

Students will learn about noted patrons of the arts, such as the Medici family in Renaissance Italy, our main focus will be on the creation of a global art market in the twentieth century. Using case studies, sample topics include: patterns of transportation, exchange and trade; the interaction of collectors, critics and curators; the spaces and contexts of display of contemporary collections; auction houses and commercial galleries; and fakes, forgeries, thefts and scandals. Special attention will be paid to considering the contemporary art market (post 1980) and the collecting, exchange and valuation of film, photography, painting, performance and installation art. Global markets for the exchange of art in Asia, Europe, Africa, North America and South America will be highlighted as well as the exhibitions of contemporary art such as the Art Basel, the Cairo Biennale and the Venice Biennale that fuel these markets.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with AMST 6696/ARTH 6696.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"WI15"},{"strm":2587,"crseId":351470,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"1101","titleShort":"Visual Literacy & Design Studi","titleLong":"Visual Literacy and Design Studio","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"STU","ssrComponentLong":"Studio","section":"501","classNbr":16306,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/21/2015","endDt":"05/06/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jre15","firstName":"John","middleName":"Jack R.","lastName":"Elliott"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall 4101","bldgDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MVR4101","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Permission of instructor is required for non-DEA majors.

Of importance to the course is the practical and conceptual relation of 20th-century visual technologies (photography, cinema, video, and computing) to their historical corollaries in the arts. The course draws on the visual traditions of both Western and non-Western societies and study texts that have defined the premises and analytic vocabularies of the visual. Through viewings, screenings, collaborative writing, and art projects, students develop the critical skills necessary to appreciate how the approaches that define visual studies complicate traditional models of defining and analyzing art objects.

However, underneath the glitter of modernity and globalization visible in the urban sprawl of contemporary Seoul are forgotten stories, stratified claims, and a tumultuous history which Japanese rule, a civil war, and US military presence.  We will examine Seoul's symbolic place in the world community as seen through the 1988 Olympics and how its minorities make this city their home.

Students will learn about noted patrons of the arts, such as the Medici family in Renaissance Italy, our main focus will be on the creation of a global art market in the twentieth century. Using case studies, sample topics include: patterns of transportation, exchange and trade; the interaction of collectors, critics and curators; the spaces and contexts of display of contemporary collections; auction houses and commercial galleries; and fakes, forgeries, thefts and scandals. Special attention will be paid to considering the contemporary art market (post 1980) and the collecting, exchange and valuation of film, photography, painting, performance and installation art. Global markets for the exchange of art in Asia, Europe, Africa, North America and South America will be highlighted as well as the exhibitions of contemporary art such as the Art Basel, the Cairo Biennale and the Venice Biennale that fuel these markets.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with AMST 6696/ARTH 6696.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SU15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":351470,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"1101","titleShort":"Visual Literacy & Design Studi","titleLong":"Visual Literacy and Design Studio","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"STU","ssrComponentLong":"Studio","section":"501","classNbr":6459,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jre15","firstName":"John","middleName":"Jack R.","lastName":"Elliott"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall 4101","bldgDescr":"M Van Rensselaer Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MVR4101","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Permission of instructor is required for non-DEA majors.

Also important will be our inquiry into the context of Dutch art production: the social, economic, and political factors that made the Dutch art market so unusually vital.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":367226,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"3461","titleShort":"Intro African American Cinema","titleLong":"Introduction to African American Cinema","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17934,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sns87","firstName":"Samantha","middleName":"Noelle","lastName":"Sheppard"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts B21","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZB21","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"AMST","catalogNbr":"3461","type":"C"},{"subject":"ASRC","catalogNbr":"3999","type":"C"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"3461","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course explores the rich and diverse history of African American filmmaking.  Focusing on films written and/or directed by African Americans, this seminar traces the history of filmmaking from the silent era to the present day.  In exploring Black cultural production and creative expression, students will consider the ways in which film is used as a medium of protest, resistance, and cultural affirmation.  We will look at films through the critical lenses of race and representation in American cinema while locating our analysis within larger frameworks of Hollywood's representation of African Americans and various cultural and social movements within local and global contexts.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":354338,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"3620","titleShort":"Lighting Design Studio I","titleLong":"Lighting Design Studio I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"STU","ssrComponentLong":"Studio","section":"501","classNbr":6608,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"edi1","firstName":"Edward","middleName":"David","lastName":"Intemann"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts 120","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZ120","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["STU"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Graded","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"3620","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The theory and practice of lighting design as a medium for artistic expression.

The proliferation of courtesy manuals, most famous of them by Castiglione and Giovanni della Casa, instructed in \"civility,\" and reflected the concern with manners, appearance, and the ideal characteristics of grace and sprezzatura. In a period preoccupied with gender roles, social class distinctions, and political power, and dominated by courts and dynastic states, the boundaries of masculinity were a particular anxiety. The self could be fashioned or constructed in portraits, self-portraits, and autobiographies, as well as through clothing, bearing, gesture, manners, speech, and the display of material goods. The course also considers some of the public and private settings in which the social self was performed, among them banquets and studies. In a time of travel, the internationalism of consumer goods, and a fascination with distinctions in dress throughout the known world, identity was also negotiated between the familiar and the foreign.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":350979,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4641","titleShort":"Comparative Modernities","titleLong":"Comparative Modernities","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16666,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"09:25PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mid1","firstName":"Iftikhar","middleName":"","lastName":"Dadi"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 144","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH144","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ART","catalogNbr":"6690","type":"C"},{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"4690","type":"C"},{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"6190","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Since the late 19th century, the effects of capitalism across the globe have been profoundly transformative and have intensified with the demise of the older colonial empires, the rise of nationalism and independent states, and the onset of neoliberal globalization.

Taught as a seminar, it assumes active participation by advanced undergraduate and graduate students who have a prior knowledge of Euro-American modernism and art history, and who wish to better understand the great artistic and visual transformations in the 20th century in a global context.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA15"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":357731,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4761","titleShort":"Art & Social Histories","titleLong":"Art and Social Histories","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16730,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"llm4","firstName":"Laura","middleName":"Lee","lastName":"Meixner"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 144","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH144","meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/25/2015","endDt":"12/04/2015","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"De-mythologizing Van Gogh & Gauguin"}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Graded(GRI)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"4761","type":"B"},{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"6761","type":"B"},{"subject":"FREN","catalogNbr":"4761","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/25/2015","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Seminar topics rotate each semester.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"Auditing not permitted.

Students will learn about noted patrons of the arts, such as the Medici family in Renaissance Italy, our main focus will be on the creation of a global art market in the twentieth century. Using case studies, sample topics include: patterns of transportation, exchange and trade; the interaction of collectors, critics and curators; the spaces and contexts of display of contemporary collections; auction houses and commercial galleries; and fakes, forgeries, thefts and scandals. Special attention will be paid to considering the contemporary art market (post 1980) and the collecting, exchange and valuation of film, photography, painting, performance and installation art. Global markets for the exchange of art in Asia, Europe, Africa, North America and South America will be highlighted as well as the exhibitions of contemporary art such as the Art Basel, the Cairo

Leonardo was an extraordinary thinker, scientist, and engineer as well as artist. Michelangelo invented grandiose projects for ambitious patrons and created a novel visual language with parallels to his poetry, and in his later years, profoundly spiritual images. Raphael, the consummate court artist, antiquarian, and archaeologist, produced a new classical style. Leonardo and Michelangelo pioneered new approaches to the study and representation of the human body. They deployed wit and humor and reinvented the grotesque from ancient art, and all influenced the proliferation of erotic art. Biographies presented them as geniuses, leading the Florentine sculptor Cellini to model himself in his autobiography on a larger-than-life Michelangelo. Florentine painters and sculptors grappled with Michelangelo's enormous inventiveness. We will also examine prints in the Johnson Museum after Michelangelo and Raphael, and consider recent attributions of new discoveries to them.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":367448,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"3522","titleShort":"Dark Passages: Film Noir","titleLong":"Dark Passages: Film Noir","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":16476,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"pd363","firstName":"Paul","middleName":"","lastName":"Dobryden"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall G22","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSHG22","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"GERST","catalogNbr":"3522","type":"C"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"3522","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course examines the origins, evolution, and contemporary resonance of film noir.

We will also discuss more recent films with surprising links to both film noir and German expressionism, including Blue Velvet (1986), Dark City (1998), and The Big Lebowski (1998).

We begin with politically-charged Montmartre cabarets—Le Chat Noir, Moulin Rouge—where shadow theater, acrobats, and quadrille dancers inspired the street posters of Toulouse-Lautrec, Steinlin, and Vallotton. We follow their influence to James Ensor's Ostend carnivals and Les XX (The Twenty), the painters' coalition dedicated to the Belgian Workers Party, and then look at fin-de-siècle print culture through Redon's haunting \"noirs,\" lithographic albums inspired by Poe's tales of horror. We consider the Pont Aven Symbolists' turn from material to dream worlds visualized through stained glass and medieval tapestry; the close ties between Neo-impressionist painters and anarchist art critics; the Nabis (Prophets) pre-cinematic crowd scenes and the Lumière Brothers; and why the Nabis Vuillard and Bonnard abandoned their easels for costume and set design at the Théâtre d'Art. We consider the 1889 exposition universelle and the pavilions that fueled mass colonial fantasies and Gauguin's departure for Tahiti. Woven throughout are larger performances of decadence, crowds, and hysteria as modernity, and tensions between industrial life and utopic longing that led Symbolists to read Monet's Giverny grainstacks series as cosmic orbs, \"the terrestrial life of the globe and the course of earth through space.\" We will see the epoch illumined by marvel—electric lighting, phantasmagoria, Jules Verne's voyages, and Méliès' enchanted cinema.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":354588,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4210","titleShort":"Dance Technique IV/Classical","titleLong":"Dance Technique IV/Classical","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"STU","ssrComponentLong":"Studio","section":"501","classNbr":5367,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"04:50PM","timeEnd":"06:20PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"pbs6","firstName":"P.","middleName":"","lastName":"Suber"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts 320","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZ320","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Course fee of $40."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["STU"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"PE","catalogNbr":"1184","type":"B"},{"subject":"PE","catalogNbr":"1186","type":"B"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"3210","type":"B"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"4210","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Advanced and pre-professional Western classical dance.

We will ask whether a focus on environmental issues can re-invigorate canonical texts of media theory, as well as how current ecocritical perspectives can contribute to film and media studies.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Weekly film screening, TBA.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":354497,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4546","titleShort":"Shakespeare In (Con)text","titleLong":"Shakespeare in (Con)text","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17472,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"12:05PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"bal5","firstName":"Bruce","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Levitt"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts 124","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZ124","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"4210","type":"C"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"4675","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Examines how collaboration among stage directors, designers, and actors leads to differing interpretations of plays.

Together these two great exponents of the Golden Age span three-quarters of their century, from the forward-looking nature of Rembrandt's oeuvre to the retrospective cast of Vermeer's. Moreover their oeuvres—one impressively large and the other equally small—exhibit startling divergent interests in the issues of visuality and representation. From their headquarters in Amsterdam and Delft, respectively, they develop contrasting studio practices and relations with the market, and explore different subjects and mediums. Topics will include: investigations of the uses of light; methods of self-representation; depictions of women and the domestic sphere; Rembrandt's experiments in etching and Vermeer's with the camera obscura and opticality; and their histories of reception, including the consequential results of the Rembrandt Research Project. We will also take advantage of the Johnson Museum Dutch painting and print collections, and the collections of the Frick and Met in NYC.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP16"},{"strm":2622,"crseId":354608,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4758","titleShort":"Technology &the Moving Body II","titleLong":"Technology and the Moving Body II","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"STU","ssrComponentLong":"Studio","section":"501","classNbr":18329,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"09:55PM","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"pbs6","firstName":"P.","middleName":"","lastName":"Suber"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts SB10","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZSB10","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/27/2016","endDt":"05/11/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["STU"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"3350","type":"B"},{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"4350","type":"B"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"3758","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/27/2016","sessionEndDt":"05/11/2016","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Continuation of PMA 3350.

In the Arab world and Israel, the film industries reflect upon struggles of self-determination. The Iranian film industry underwent significant changes following the Islamic Revolution of 1979. By viewing a range of films from the Arab world, including North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as from Turkey, Israel, and Iran, we will consider the significance of these national rubrics and how they have shaped the work of filmmakers throughout the Middle East.   Films also reach beyond the boundaries of the nation, and so, we will consider how these films transcend national borders. On the one hand we will consider limit factors, like censorship, and the role of language and dialect on film viewership and distribution. And, on the other hand, we will consider the influence of external forces, such as the influence of foreign film markets in Europe and North America on filmmakers in the Middle East, as well as the effects of foreign financing—both from Europe and the Gulf States.  All films will be screened with English subtitles.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA16"},{"strm":2643,"crseId":350636,"crseOfferNbr":3,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"2300","titleShort":"American Cinema","titleLong":"American Cinema","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":16770,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"07:30PM","timeEnd":"08:45PM","startDt":"08/23/2016","endDt":"12/02/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"sh322","firstName":"Sabine","middleName":"","lastName":"Haenni"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall G64-Kau Aud","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSHG64","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Film viewing is required for this class.

What kinds of images emerged, and what purposes did they serve? What did the buying public do with these images on paper? Taught in the Johnson Museum with its extensive collection of prints and co-led by curator of European art Andrew Weislogel and director Stephanie Wiles, the first aim of this seminar is to experience original masterworks by the most prominent printmakers of the period, including Mantegna, Dürer, Goltzius, Rembrandt, and Hogarth. We will consider the techniques and materiality of prints, look at fakes and forgeries, and discuss patterns of publishing and collecting. A second aim is to examine through analysis of weekly readings themes that concerned printmakers and their viewers. Among class topics are religion and allegory, witches and beggars, humor and satire, portraits of people, cities, and landscapes, issues of self-fashioning, invention, and replication, and prints as sites of knowledge about the expanding world.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP17"},{"strm":2657,"crseId":354513,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4563","titleShort":"Lightin Design Studio II","titleLong":"Lighting Design Studio II","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"STU","ssrComponentLong":"Studio","section":"501","classNbr":7930,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:30PM","timeEnd":"04:25PM","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"edi1","firstName":"Edward","middleName":"David","lastName":"Intemann"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Perform Arts 120","bldgDescr":"Schwartz Ctr-Performing Arts","facilityDescrshort":"SWZ120","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/25/2017","endDt":"05/10/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["STU"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"PMA","catalogNbr":"4620","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/25/2017","sessionEndDt":"05/10/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Concentrates on designing lighting for different genres of performance in various venues.

On the edge literally and metaphorically, these cities seem to be about competing visions of urban form, culture, and modernity. And the iconic forms of New York (tenements and skyscrapers) and of Los Angeles (highways and suburban homes) have fascinated film makers from the 19th century to the present day. We will both evoke and complicate the contrast between New York and Los Angeles by mapping the intersections of each city with cinema. We explore how the urban experience has been said to give rise to particular cinematic forms and the ways in which cinematic styles may be translated into urban design. Topics may include density and sprawl; place and creativity; class and ethnicity; race and gender; culture and commercialism; industrial and media economies; and insularism and cosmopolitanism. Screenings will include documentary, experimental, and commercial films and cover such genres as early actualities, city symphonies, film noir, science fiction, etc. Readings will be drawn from theories and histories of film, urbanism, and architecture. Possible field

The proliferation of courtesy manuals, most famous of them by Castiglione and Giovanni della Casa, instructed in \"civility,\" and reflected the concern with manners, appearance, and the ideal characteristics of grace and sprezzatura. In a period preoccupied with gender roles, social class distinctions, and political power, and dominated by courts and dynastic states, the boundaries of masculinity were a particular anxiety. The self could be fashioned or constructed in portraits, self-portraits, and autobiographies, as well as through clothing, bearing, gesture, manners, speech, and the display of material goods. The course also considers some of the public and private settings in which the social self was performed, among them banquets and studies. In a time of travel, the internationalism of consumer goods, and a fascination with distinctions in dress throughout the known world, identity was also negotiated between the familiar and the foreign.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"FA17"},{"strm":2678,"crseId":368935,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4615","titleShort":"Electronic

Leonardo was an extraordinary thinker, scientist, and engineer as well as artist. Michelangelo invented grandiose projects for ambitious patrons and created a novel visual language with parallels to his poetry, and in his later years, profoundly spiritual images. Raphael, the consummate court artist, antiquarian, and archaeologist, produced a new classical style. Leonardo and Michelangelo pioneered new approaches to the study and representation of the human body. They deployed wit and humor and reinvented the grotesque from ancient art, and all influenced the proliferation of erotic art. Biographies presented them as geniuses, leading the Florentine sculptor Cellini to model himself in his autobiography on a larger-than-life Michelangelo. Florentine painters and sculptors grappled with Michelangelo's enormous inventiveness. We will also examine prints in the Johnson Museum after Michelangelo and Raphael, and consider recent attributions of new discoveries to them.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":369033,"crseOfferNbr":5,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"3545","titleShort":"Screening the Middle Ages","titleLong":"Screening the Middle Ages","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":17182,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"ecb234","firstName":"Erik","middleName":"Christopher","lastName":"Born"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in English.

activities, marriage alliances, and commercial contacts engendered by the Spanish colonial enterprise brought Spaniards, Africans, and Indigenous peoples into dynamic contact.  This cross-fertilization of cultures resulted in the construction of new cultural categories and colonial identities whose reverberations continue to be felt into the present day.  This seminar explores the role that visual culture played in the articulation of identity in Latin America.  For the purposes of this seminar, \"identity\" can be loosely defined as the overlapping allegiances to which one ascribes, whether racial, cultural, gendered, religious, or community-based.  The visual culture of colonial Latin America can reveal multitudes on the construction of self and community across temporal and geographical contexts.  We will explore a variety of colonial Latin American objects and images, including paintings, textiles, and material culture.  Our discussions of images will be guided by readings on hybridity, coloniality, cross-cultural exchange, and the early modern Atlantic world.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":354513,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4563","titleShort":"Lightin

As we focus on African artists and theorists, we also read American and European theorists, including but not certainly limited to Giorgio Agamben, Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, and Joseph Slaughter, detecting the ways in which discourses around bodies in the African context may shape contemporary theories and vice versa.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: 15 students.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS","roster":"SP18"},{"strm":2692,"crseId":364903,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"6155","titleShort":"Topics in Latin American Art","titleLong":"Topics in Latin American Art","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":9209,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"12:20PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"mf252","firstName":"Maria","middleName":"","lastName":"Fernandez"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/24/2018","endDt":"05/09/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Latin American Modernisms and Technology"}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPI","gradingBasisShort":"Opt NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"4155","type":"B"},{"subject":"ARTH","catalogNbr":"6155","type":"B"},{"subject":"LATA","catalogNbr":"4155","type":"B"},{"subject":"LATA","catalogNbr":"6155","type":"B"},{"subject":"VISST","catalogNbr":"4155","type":"B"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"01/24/2018","sessionEndDt":"05/09/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This seminar will investigate question such, such as: How does the inclusion of technologically engaged practices in the history of Latin American art challenge our understanding of this art?
