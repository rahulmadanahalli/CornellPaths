Students will learn how real-world problems can be solved using models, algorithms, and statistical tools. The course is organized around a set of team-based scientific computing projects drawn from various engineering and life science fields, using actual research and/or industrial computational codes. Leveraging simplified and user-friendly software interfaces and tutorials, the course focuses on the inductive learning of key concepts and topics such as physical and computational model formulation, verification and validation, uncertainty analysis, post-processing and data mining, and a high-level introduction to high performance computing. The course culminates with a community-engaged project, in which students are introduced to the basics of engineering design and team management to develop and animate a scientific computing activity in collaboration with, and tailored for, the Sciencenter.  Future Science Leaders program for middle- and high-schoolers. No prior programming experience is necessary, and a high-school math level is assumed. Enthusiasm for computer-based activities and interest in community outreach is strongly recommended.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Open to all Cornell students regardless of major, with interest in science, computer-based activities, and community outreach. ","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Intro to Engineering.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"EN"}]
