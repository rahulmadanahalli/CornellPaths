Topics include transmission of genes and chromosomes, sex determination, and chromosomal abnormalities. Students will analyze and discuss problems and case studies using classical pedigree analysis and probability theory. They will acquire sufficient understanding the functions of DNA, RNA and proteins and the technologies for analyzing them to be able to participate in class discussions, concerning the human genome project, genomics, including personal genomics, and ethical implications for human society. The class will meet three times a week with two lecture style presentations and one session devoted to active participatory discussion of emerging social issues related to human genetics and genomics.

Emphasizes the role of full genome knowledge in expediting this process of gene discovery. Stresses the role of statistical inference in interpreting genomic information. Population genetics, and the central role of understanding variation in the human genome in mediating variation in disease risk, are explored in depth. Methods such as homozygosity mapping, linkage disequilibrium mapping, and admixture mapping are examined. The format is a series of lectures with classroom discussion.

Students will be able to explain how each component of biochemistry is connected to others.","Most of the information that students are asked to master is contained in approximately 800 pages of text reading assignments, along with the course-specific 320 page Lecture Guide.

Students will be able to choose any protein or small molecule whose structure has been determined, and display that molecule on a computer screen.","Students learn to use simple but quantitative principles to understand important biological phenomena. We emphasize the interconnections of vast amounts of information, particularly in metabolism, that are the basis for how cells stay alive.
