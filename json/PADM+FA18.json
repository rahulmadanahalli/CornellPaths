Students engage in a \"Public Policy Challenge\" (modeled after business school competitions) that builds real-world skills as team members work together on a policy proposal and civic campaign to address a real problem in the community with an innovative solution. Working intensively with faculty, team members, and the local community, students will listen to and learn from local community members and literature about problems and needs, select and frame the policy challenge and design a solution, and develop community engagement, marketing, funding and evaluation plans for implementation. Students who complete this course will have the option to join the CIPA team that presents at the National Invitational Public Policy Challenge, hosted by the Fels Institute of Government at the University of Pennsylvania, in late March.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"HE"},{"strm":2713,"crseId":367581,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"PADM","catalogNbr":"5950","titleShort":"Special Topics:CIPA Intern Cap","titleLong":"Special Topics: Cornell Institute for Public Affairs International Capstone","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":14094,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"01:05PM","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ljm44","firstName":"Laurie","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Miller"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Enrollment limited to: MPA students."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/23/2018","endDt":"12/04/2018","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"GRD","gradingBasisShort":"Graded","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08/23/2018","sessionEndDt":"12/04/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Provides 2nd year MPA students with opportunities to practice skills they've learned in their coursework and professional experiences to address policy or management problems for real-world clients in government or nonprofit agencies worldwide.
