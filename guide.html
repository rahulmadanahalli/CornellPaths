<b>Welcome to Cornell Paths!</b>

<p>
Here's a guide to help you guys understand what you're seeing
</p>

<p>
<b>Why don't I see anything...</b>
<br>
Ok. Choose a semester in the first box and a subject in the next one (you can choose up to 2 subjects to display at a time). You can also choose "All" in the first box if you want to see all the courses that are offered for a subject. A graph should show up in the center screen where each class is a node and links represent edges the pre-requisite relationship between classes. The classes on the top are lower level whereas the class on the bottom are upper level.
</p>


<p>
<b>Water all these lines?!</b>
<br>
Ok. Given any semester and subject, it displays all courses in that subject in that semester ALONG WITH all the first degree prerequistes for those courses (so I don't show the pre-reqs of the pre-reqs). When hovering over a class, the blue edges go to pre-requisites of that class and the red edges go to classes that you can take after that class!
</p>

<p>
<b>Why do I see some courses that aren't in the subject that I chose?</b>
<br>
Ok. I wanted to display ALL the pre-reqs of each course in a subject, so that users don't have incomplete information about the pre-req path for a course. Some of those pre-reqs might not be in the same subject!
</p>

<p>
<b>Why are some courses hard to see, are they trying to hide from me?!</b>
<br>
Ok. If a class is opaque, then that's because it's not offered that semester OR the class was last offered before 2014, so we have no data about it.
</p>

<p>
<b>I want to know more about a class than just a colorful bubble and a course number, please halp</b>
<br>
Ok. Clicking on a class displays a high-level description on the top. Click on the blue course number in the top bar to redirect to the cornell course roster website.
</p>

<p>
<b>Why did you do this...</b>
<br>
Well. I thought there could be a better way to visualize courses. Seeing them as paths, hopefully people can have a better experience discovering cool courses to take next.
</p>

<p>
<b>I want to spam your email</b>
<br>
Ok. If you have any questions or concerns or feature requests feel free to reach out to me on Facebook or email me at rm768 [at] cornell [dot] edu.
